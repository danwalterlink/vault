  bladesinging
    \+{core: replaces "song of victory"} you can choose to add your int ability modifier for melee weapon attacks made as part of casting a spell instead.
      heroic: for all weapon attacks while your bladesong is active.
    \+{heroic} replace somatic components of spells that target a creature within your reach with an attack. You may change the spell's range to touch.
    \+{grand}
      [Spellstain] When you mark a creature while casting a spell, that mark becomes a spellstained mark.
      [arcane maneuver: echoing spellstain]&#x3A;
        You may either, when casting a spell with range touch:

```
    - echo the spell for each spellstained creature.
    - change the target of an effect targeting you to the creature you attack.
    - as a bonus action, teleport to an unoccupied space within reach of a marked creature.

+{epic}
  [polyphony] you may choose other targets when making weapon attacks as part of casting a spell. For each target you may cast a spell of a level up to the number of targets.
  [arcane maneuver: finale -]: after an attack when casting a spell, you may end your bladesong. If you do so, either:
    [of devastation] you may recast a spell resulting in melee weapon attacks for each different target you cast during this bladesong. You may cast these spells using spell slots totaling half their cumulative level on each target.
    [reprise] regain spell points equal to half your expended spell points expended with spells resulting in melee weapon attacks.
