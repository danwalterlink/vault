mode
  models keyboard/text driven interfaces to contexts and actions in these forms

hypr
  hypr app
    shift
      if_alone: next window
      chord: space : picker/chooser

arrangements, sessions, modes, define-in-use, plaintext definitions, pluggable

emacs
vim
vscode
  workspaces, projects

chords
  fixed :
  flown : any keybinding can be a prefix -> if not exist : define flow

functions/flows
    while flow key held down: chord until released
  navigate
  chain (space) (empty chain -> take "to current")

  ## ddublu
  streamOfConsciousness - filter task
  noted thought
associate task - orgmode
  gather in task nod/te


  ## functions
  move focus to topmost window to {{motion}} -> similar to window/pane/tmux/vim nesting navigation behaviour

  ### vscode
  #### dendron
  autologging - timed autocommit on significant actions -> #issue compute significance
    memory | significance | computability

systemwide - define INTENT -> informs workflows

#feature history -> eg. tab

#feature semantic commit - squash to intent
-> automated autosave commits get squashed

implementation dendron plugins
implement touchbar/pad into workflows
  -> selection tmux panels

keyboard - space while holding non-modifiers repeats held inputs
  chords in karabiner? #os.mac
  -> implementation difficulty
  check: current karabiner implementation

- [ ] [[tmux]]
- tmux: attach to pane
