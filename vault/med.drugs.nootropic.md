[They work in a variety of different ways](http://nootriment.com/do-nootropics-work/), though many share similar mechanisms of action. Some increase the supply of neurtransmitters and other neurochemicals that are involved in intra- and inter-neuron communication as well as brain signalling pathways related to cognition, memory formation and recall.
Some may enhance brain activity by modulating neuroreceptors, increasing the uptake of oxygen, glucose and other nutrients into brain cells or by promoting the underlying health of brain systems. Still other nootropics have been shown to stimulate the development of new neurons ans synapses, increases the overall plasticity of the brain.

## Nootropics

[The phrase “nootropic” was coined by Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea](http://nootriment.com/nootropics-definition/) following the discovery of a remarkable substance known as “Piracetam”. His research team first synthesized this compound in 1964 when working at the Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB. His research into Piracetam was initially motivated by the search for a treatment for motion sickness.
However, early trials with Piracetam found that it had a distinct ability to improve memory, mental processing, focus and performance across a battery of cognitive tests. Not only this, it lacked any significant side effects and did not share the pharmacology of typical psychotropic drugs such as nervous system stimulation or depression.
This was truly an unprecedented discovery and it opened the door to developing other cognitive enhancement drugs that could improve mental functioning in healthy adults as well as those suffering from brain disorders. In 1972, Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” to describe [Piracetam and the class of yet-to-be discovered analogs](http://nootriment.com/piracetam-vs-aniracetam-vs-oxiracetam-vs-pramiracetam/) of this substance.
The term itself is of Greek origin, coming from the word “nous” which means “mind” and the root “tropo-” which translates into “turning” or “change”. Thus, we can think of nootropics as substances that change the mind in some way. Giurgea laid out a strict set of definitions for the class, requiring that they must enhance learning and memory, exhibit neuroprotective effects and show extremely low toxicity and almost no side effects.
Today, Nootropics are used by a broad range of society and for a broad range of purposes from improving academic performance to boosting productivity to supporting healthy brain function and preventing cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. The following is a list of over 120 popular nootropics and related compounds with nootropic properties that contribute to [cognitive enhancement](http://nootriment.com/cognitive-enhancement/).
Beneath each nutrient, supplement or drug you will find a brief description of its chemical classification, mechanisms of action and effects on the brain. You will also find user ratings for each of these compounds in terms of their effects on Memory, Focus and Mood.

##### Racetams

Racetams are the founding class of Nootropics, based on derivatives of Piracetam. In addition to this archetype, they include Aniracetam, Oxiracetam, Pramiracetam, Phenylpiracetam, Nefiracetam, Coluracetam and others. They share similar chemical structures based on a 2-pyrrolidone nucleus composed of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen.
Many of the effects of Racetams are similar as they related to improving brain health, learning, memory and focus. But there is also great diversity within this class in terms of potency and individual characteristics of the supplements listed below. All Racetams seem to be able to increase acetylcholine neurotransmitter activity in the brain and some are also capable of increasing glutamate activity via AMPA and NMDA receptors.

##### [Piracetam](http://nootriment.com/piracetam/)

Piracetam – also known as 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide – is a cyclic derivative of the neurochemical GABA. This original nootropic is a positive modulator for receptoprs of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter which plays a role in fluid intelligence and short-term working memory capacity. Piracetam is also believed to improve the membrane permeability of neurons which enhances overall neuronal function as it relates to communication, healthy development and synaptic plasticity.
This nootropic is reported by users to improve focus, attentiveness, memory formation and recall, information processing as well as several factors related to mood. It is used as an off-label ADHD treatment and remains to this day the most popular nootropic among first-time users.
Other Names: [Nootropil](http://nootriment.com/nootropil/), [Nootropyl](http://nootriment.com/nootropyl), [Nooracetam](http://nootriment.com/nooracetam/)

Focus: (image/gif)
Mood: (image/gif)

##### [Aniracetam](http://nootriment.com/aniracetam/)

Aniracetam – (1(4-methoxybenzoyl)-2-pyrrolidinone) – is a derivative of Piracetam that is said to be 5x more potent than its parent compound. Unlike Piracetam, it is fat-soluble which may contribute to its faster onset of effects as well as a shorter half-life. It shares the common Racetam effects of enhancing memory and focus by activating Nicotinic Acetylcholine receptors in the brain. It also stimulates AMPA receptor sites which are implicated in learning as well as memory encoding processes.
This unique mechanism of action has made Aniracetam the model for another class of nootropics known as AMPAkines. Finally, it is believed to activate D2 and D3 Dopamine receptors as well as the 5-HTP(2a) receptor involved in Serotonin processing. This explains why user reviews say Aniracetam is effective as an anti-anxiety and anti-depression treatment in addition to its traditional nootropic benefits.

##### [Oxiracetam](http://nootriment.com/oxiracetam/)

Oxiracetam – (RS)-2-(4-hydroxy-2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)acetamide – is both a Racetam and an Ampakine that is said to be 4-6 times stronger than Piracetam. It increases brain activity in cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways and exhibits some stimulant-like effects. Oxiracetam is particularly noted for improving reasoning, verbal processing, spatial learning. logical and mathematical thinking as well as focus and memory.
These attributes are highly correlated with the g-factor of intelligence and Oxiracetam – more than any other Racetam – is described as boosting intellectual function. It is commonly used as a study aid among students in highly technical subjects such as the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) fields.

Focus: (image/gif)
Mood: (image/gif)

##### [Pramiracetam](http://nootriment.com/pramiracetam/)

Pramiracetam – N-[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl]-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)acetamide – is a Piracetam analogue that is 30x more potent. It influences both Glutamate and Acetylcholine neuroreceptors and particularly increases reuptake at ACh receptor sites as well as increasing the efficiency of nerve impulse channels in the hippocampus. This region of the brain is implicated as having a central role in memory formation as well as recall.
Using Pramiracetam produces a great sense of mental clarity and concentration while also improving critical thinking skills and the speed of information processing. Individuals typically take Pramiracetam to improve their memory retention while enabling them to be more productive, attentive, focused and alert.

##### [Noopept](http://nootriment.com/noopept/)

Noopept – N-Phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester – is not technically a Racetam, though it is derived from this class and use a similar mechanisms of action. It has a different chemical structure which technically makes it a neuropeptide, said to be over 1000x times more concentrated than Piracetam. The effective dosage for Noopept powder is between 10 – 40 mg which is exceptional small in comparison to other Racetams. Noopept demonstrates very high affinity for ACh, AMPA and NDMA receptors that relate to short-term and long-term memory.
Like Aniracetam, it also activates D2 an D3 receptors for Dopamine as well as selective Serotonin receptors. These systems are involved in mood and motivation which is why Noopept is seen as being effective for disorders such as depression and anxiety.
Noopept further increases Nerve Growth Factor levels which is a hormone involved in the maintenance and repair of healthy brain cells. It is being investigated as a possible treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders including Age-Related Memory Loss.

##### [Phenylpiracetam](http://nootriment.com/phenylpiracetam/)

Phenylpiracetam – (RS)-2-(2-oxo-4-phenylpyrrolidin-1-yl)acetamide – was synthesized by adding a phenyl group molecule to Piracetam’s chemical structure. This alteration has made it significantly more bioavailable than its progenitor and with a 60x greater potency. It is a positive modulator of acetylcholine and glutamate synaptic receptors and may be able to increase the density of hippocampal NMDA receptors. These receptors are integral to the process of Long-Term Potentiation which is how memories are stored as connections between neurons.
Phenylpiracetam also raises Dopamine and Noradrenalin levels in the brain which gives it both mood-enhancing and mentally stimulating properties. It is described as producing intense focus, mental drive and motivation while also enhancing memory consolidation and physical performance.

##### [Coluracetam](http://nootriment.com/coluracetam/)

Coluracetam – N-(2,3-dimethyl-5,6,7,8- tetrahydrofuro[2,3-b] quinolin-4-yl)-2- (2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)acetamide – is a Racetam compound with 10-20x the potency of Piracetam. It works by increasing the uptake of choline into neurons which leads to an increase in acetylcholine levels and Cholinergic activity. Coluracetam is believed to show a distinct ability to improve Choline uptake in damaged neurons and may offer long-term benefits for memory-impaired individuals.
It also influences areas of the brain that are involved in visual processing and is said to improve eyesight and color perception. Other studies have shown it to be effective in treating General Anxiety Disorder as well as depression.

Mood: (image/gif)

##### [Nefiracetam](http://nootriment.com/nefiracetam/)

Nefiracetam – N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)acetamide – is a Racetam with a similar chemical structure to Aniracetam. It is believed to increase brain activity by potentiating excitatory neurotransmission through prolonging the opening of calcium channels. It also binds to nicotinic Acetylcholine receptors and enhances communication in GABAergc, Cholinergic, monoaminergic and glutamatergic neuronal systems. Nefiracetam is highly cytoprotective and may be able to treat individuals suffering from cognitive decline as well as Alzheimer’s and cerebrovascular dementia.
Trials have found it to be more effective for increasing attention span, concentration, memory function, and spatial learning ability compared to other Racetams. It is also considered to be a more powerful anxiolytic than Aniracetam and was shown to be successful in the treatment of clinical depression.

##### Cholinergics

The Cholinergic system refers to those components of the nervous system that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to communicate. Acetylcholine (ACh) is an excitatory brain chemical that is involved in many facets of mental function such as attention, synaptic plasticity, wakefulness, and the reward system. Increasing cholinergic activity may lead to improved focus, working memory, alertness, mental clarity and performance across a number of intelligence measurements.
Cholinergic Nootropics are able to increase stimulation of ACh receptors either by raising levels of acetylcholine, preventing the degradation of this neurochemical, or by potentiating or activating these receptors in some way. A direct way to increase acetylcholine levels is by consuming more Choline which is a dietary nutrient used to synthesize this transmitter.

##### [Choline](http://nootriment.com/choline/)

Choline – 2-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium – is a water-soluble essential nutrient that was recently named to the B-complex family of vitamins. It is necessary for the development and maintenance of health brain cell membranes to ensure effective signalling, structural integrity and neuronal fluidity. This nutrient is also used alongside acetic acid to synthesizes acetylcholine in neurons. Sources of choline are commonly used alongside the Racetams in nootropic stacks due to their complimentary mechanisms of action.
The American Institute of Medicine recommends that adults get at least 425 – 550 mg of choline in their diets every day. However, as much as 90% of the population is estimated to be deficient in this nutrient. Increasing choline intake by eating foods such as eggs, chicken, soy lecithin, wheat germ and cod fish may improve mental performance and prevent age-related cognitive decline.
Not all choline sources are made equally and as much as 50% of the choline we eat may be degraded by bacteria in the gut. Some choline supplements marketed today are known to have very low bio-availability with only a small percentage able to cross the blood-brain barrier.

##### [Alpha GPC](http://nootriment.com/alpha-gpc/)

Alpha GPC – [(2S)-2,3-Dihydroxypropyl] 2-trimethylazaniumylethyl phosphate – is a source of choline derived naturally from soy lecithin. It also occurs naturally in the brain as well as in human breast milk and may be a contributing factor to the higher IQ observed in children that have been breast-fed. It has the highest bio-availability of the nootropic Choline supplements and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.
Once in the brain, it is metabolized into acetylcholine which can then be used for inter-neuronal communication related to short-term memory, learning and attention. Alpha GPC can also slow the process of brain aging as a cognitive anti-oxidant and it is observed to increase Human Growth Hormone levels. Individuals who use Alpha GPC say that it improves memory performance, eliminates brain fog and improves focus.

Other Names: [Alpha Glycerylphosphorylcholine](http://nootriment.com/alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine/), [Choline Alfoscerate](http://nootriment.com/choline-alfoscerate/), [GPC Choline](http://nootriment.com/gpc-choline/)

##### [Citicoline](http://nootriment.com/citicoline/)

Citicoline – 5′-O-[hydroxy({hydroxy[2-(trimethylammonio)ethoxy] phosphoryl}oxy)phosphoryl]cytidine – is an acetylcholine precursor with high bio-availability that occurs naturally as an intermediary in the conversion of choline into phosphatidylcholine in the liver. Phosphatidylcholine is a phospholipid that is incorporated into neuronal cell membranes and can be used in acetylcholine synthesis. Citicoline increases the availability of choline in the brain by freeing up quantities of choline that would otherwise be used in the generation of phosphatidylcholine.
It can therefore indirectly increase acetylcholine levels while also improving cell memebrane function in neurons and preventing depletion of phospholipids which can lead to brain damage and mental decline. This supplement also protects against oxidative stress, reduces inflammation in the cerebral cortex, and stimulates the release of dopamine in the brain. It is an effective component of nootropic stacks designed to enhance memory, thinking, concentration and mood.

##### [Centrophenoxine](http://nootriment.com/centrophenoxine/)

Centrophenoxine – 2-Dimethylaminoethyl (4-chlorophenoxy)acetate – is an ester of DMAE with a higher bio-availibility. DMAE is sometimes used as a choline source, however new studies show that it is not as effective as was once believed. Centrophenoxine appears much more effective for raising acetylcholine levels because it is better able to cross the Blood-Brain barrier. Research suggests Centropheonxine may improve mood and ADHD via cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways.
It is also a potent brain anti-oxidant and is shown to reduce lipofuscin waste deposits that build up in brain cells as we age. Centrophenoxine is highly synergistic with Racetams in memory-enhancement nootropic stacks and will also boost focus, clarity of thought, mood as well as brain health.

##### [Choline Citrate](http://nootriment.com/choline-citrate/)

Choline Citrate is a supplemental combination of Choline with Citric Acid that you may find marketed in brain supplements. As a source of choline, it can increase available levels of acetylcholine in the brain which supports better memory function and reasoning as well as improved synaptic plasticity. However, this formulation is considered to have low bio-availability and lacks the added nootropic benefits of supplements such as Citicoline and Alpha GPC.

Epiphany D1 is a memory pill and mental focus nootropic stack supplement. Its ingredients include Aniracetam, Oxiracetam, Sulbutiamine, Bacopa Monnieri, Vinpocetine, Mucuna Pruriens, and Alpha GPC Choline. Aniracetam and Oxiracetam interact with acetylcholine receptors and AMPA glutamate receptors to increase short and long term memory, improve information processing, and facilitate logical reasoning.
Alpha GPC boosts choline, which converts into acetylcholine, the key neurotransmitter relating to memory and fluid intelligence. Sulbutiamine acts as an energy enhancing mood lifter. Vinpocetine and Mucuna Pruriens produce energy and balance Dopamine levels. Epiphany D1’s benefits include enhanced memory, heightened concentration, better blood flow to the brain, and anti-aging effects.

##### Stimulants

Stimulants are pharmacological compounds which induce temporary changes to mental and physical conditions, usually relating to energy levels. Stimulants produce these effects by chemically boosting or inhibiting various activities of the central and peripheral nervous systems. These effects can be achieved via the production of neurohormones like norepinephrine and dopamine, as well as interaction/agonism/antagonism of specific receptor cells.
Stimulant benefits can include mental focus and alertness, greater motivation, sexual arousal, higher athletic endurance, and reduced appetite. Stimulants can also be powerful mood lifters. They can be used to treat a variety of cognitive disorders, such as OCD, ADHD, and depression. Under the technical definition for nootropics, stimulants are specifically precluded due to the prevalence of associated side effects. However, many users will stack stimulants with nootropics for improved benefits.

##### [Geranamine](http://nootriment.com/geranamine/)

Geranamine, also known as Methylhexanamine or DMAA, is a stimulant which is similar to compounds derived from Geranium plants. Geranamine acts upon excitatory receptors in much the same way that pseudoephedrine and ephedrine work. Geranamine causes the release of norepinephrine and possibly also dopamine. Geranamine was originally intended as a nasal decongestant.
Used as a nootropic stimulant, it can improve mental focus and attention span. It may also improve athletic performance. This is a synthetic product that is not identical to natural Geranium Oil. Its safety as a dietary supplement has been challenged by various sport and U.S. government health agencies, which have banned its use outright.

##### [Ephedrine](http://nootriment.com/ephedrine/)

Ephedrine is an organic stimulant which is derived from the alkaloids of the Ephedra Sinica or Ma Huang plant. Ephedrine stimulates the adrenergic system by boosting noradrenaline and imitating adrenaline. It also raises metabolism through thermogenesis, the conversion of calories into heat energy.
Ephedrine does not target individual cognitive processes, but instead stimulates autonomic activity of the central nervous system, the unconscious network which controls visceral action. Benefits include intense energy, and the ability to concentrate upon tasks for a long period of time. Use of Ephedrine is banned by the FDA for any reason other than asthma, cold, or respiratory illness.

##### [Nicotine](http://nootriment.com/nicotine/)

Nicotine is a plant-based parasympathomimetic alkaloid. When consumed or smoked, the compound acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. This means it increases the volume of nicotinic receptors in the brain. This action causes the release of more acetylcholine, a powerful neurotransmitter related to memory, learning, and sensory sensitivity.
Nicotine’s benefits include mental alertness, calm and focused thoughts, and the ability to concentrate. It can be a powerful mood lifter. Nicotine is fast acting and considered highly addictive, with severe withdrawals and high potential for abuse. It does have some positive long term effects, such as some protection from Alzheimer’s disease.

Mood: (image/gif)

##### [Octopamine](http://nootriment.com/octopamine/)

Octopamine is an endogenous biogenic amine derived from the amino acid Tyramine. It is very similar to the neurohormone norepinephrine. Octopamine activates metabolism of fat cells by stimulating beta3 adrenergic receptors. Octopamine also interacts with norepinephrine and dopamine receptor cells, and may act in much the same way as those neurochemicals.
Octopamine can cause spiked increases to physical and mental energy. It creates a perception of mental alertness and heightened awareness to sensory information of all kinds. Octopamine’s metabolism effects can lead to desirable weight loss and increased efficacy of body building regimens. Higher metabolism in the brain can create a sense of fluid intelligence, with easy access to memories and fast-moving thoughts.

##### [Yohimbine HCL](http://nootriment.com/yohimbine-hcl/)

Yohimbine HCL is an MAO inhibitor derived from the West African Yohimbe tree. Yohimbine HCL is considered a stimulant because it increases the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, regulator of the body’s fight or flight reactions. It does this by raising levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. This effect also increases the body’s rate of metabolism through thermogenesis, leading to more fat burning.
Yohimbine HCL is primarily used to boost energy levels. It makes the mental focus and concentration required for activities like studying easier and more productive. Its MAOi properties can help regulate mood and create a sense of optimism and motivation. It clears brain fog, and enhances memory, reaction time, and libido. Yohimbe balances the side effects of SSRI medication, and promotes weight loss when combined with exercise.

##### Xanthines

Xanthines are a class of stimulants derived from xanthine, a purine base found in the tissues of almost all organic life. These alkaloids exhibit excitatory or stimulant effects in the central and sympathetic nervous systems. They can also act as bronchodilators, opening bronchial passages. Xanthines restrict the effects of adenosine, a natural chemical which causes sensations of sleepiness. Xanthines can raise heart rate and boost circulation. They also can increase the activity of the respiratory system.
Xanthines are typically taken for mild, short-term energy boosts. They can lift mood, provide mental focus, and create a sense of alertness. Some of these compounds, such as Caffeine, are considered highly addictive and can produce strong withdrawal effects when usage is ceased.

##### [Caffeine](http://nootriment.com/caffeine/)

Caffeine, a xanthine alkaloid compound, is the most commonly used psychostimulant on Earth. Found in plant seeds, leaves, and fruit, such as coffee beans, caffeine possesses strong dopaminergic activity. This means it stimulates the release of the natural neurotransmitter dopamine, generating intense mental focus and improved mood. Caffeine has the ability to replace adenosine, a chemical which the body uses to regulate over-excited nerve reactions.
Caffeine’s benefits include better concentration and control, the stimulation of creative thoughts, physical energy, and improved memory. Over the long term, caffeine can possibly prevent serious conditions like Parkinson’s disease and colon cancer. Caffeine’s mood enhancing effects are strong but short-lived, and may cause addiction and withdrawals after extended use.

##### [Green Tea](http://nootriment.com/green-tea/)

Green Tea is a commonly consumed stimulant derived from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. It can be boiled into a beverage or extracted into a supplement powder. Green tea has a high concentration of flavonoids, phytochemicals with very strong anti-oxidant benefits. Green tea also contains the stimulant caffeine, though in smaller amounts than in coffee. This natural tea lowers blood sugar and stimulates fat burning, via a synergistic relationship between the supplement and noradrenaline.
Green tea also contains L-Theanine, a noted anti-stress and anti-anxiety compound. Its benefits include enhanced wakefulness, increased mental focus, better memory, heightened concentration, and energy. It has excellent anti-oxidant properties, and boosts overall immunity. Green tea can also lift mood, without the harsher side effects associated with other caffeine supplements.

Hey Neal, Thanks for pointing out that Ginkgo Biloba is missing! It should definitely be on the list – will add it now. Here’s our article on Ginkgo if you are looking for information: http://nootriment.com/ginkgo-biloba/
I’ve never tried the Neuro Natural Recall product from Xtend-life but one comment I have generally on their products is they tend to throw so many different ingredients into their formulas but don’t do a great job of balancing dosages. For example, in one serving of Neuro Natural Recall you get 1/3rd the recommended dosage of ALCAR but 3x the recommended dosage for Huperzine A. Plus it’s also pretty expensive at around $2.5 a serving. Have you used it? What do you think of it?

Hey.
I have used their TB line of products aswell as some others, but I’ve never tried the Neuro line because of the expense, as you pointed out.
I will say this though; based on my experience with their other products, they work! You feel the difference. As it relates to to their ingredients profile, they focus on synergism. Based on their explanation, the doses are selected based on how they compliment each other. So it wouldn’t necessarily be as high as if you were using an ingredient by itself.
It seems logical, and their products seem to work well with this principle.

Seemingly, the best improvement I have experienced in memory, especially long-term memory is with Complimina Retard (xanthinol nicotinate) at 500 t.i.d., as per the study by Loriaux – http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3936095.
I only see it sold by one vendor in the 150 mg dose, not enough.
The 500 mg dose yields 141.7 mg of XN, which is the dose used in Loriaux’s study. (t.i.d)
I notice an improvement within the first week, which only gets better over time.
Haven’t you read about it and will you consider carrying it?

I think you should look into adding D-serine to the list as it is a new amino acid that shows promising results in trials done on people with parkinson’s. Not sure if it would fall into the dopaminergenic group as I don’t know the mechanism of action but credible research is out there. It seems to enhance memory aswell.

Currently, iam researching for the right mix of nootropic. Your list sure help me a lot.
I’ll use modafinil + noopept as the combo.
Modafinil as the stimulant and noopept as the cognitive enhancer.
And because modafinil have the tolerance issue (which i have now), ill cycle it with adderall + noopept…

One valuable addition would be references to studies that support the beneficial claims. It would probably be time consuming so perhaps at least for the more popular items such as Noopept (the drill down from this list states “a number of studies” for example).

Cylert (pemoline) is not a narcotic – it was classified as a stimulant, and it was taken off the market because of toxicity issues – you shouldn’t even list it.
“Pemoline is Schedule IV Non-Narcotic (Stimulant) controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 1530 and is not subject to annual manufacturing quotas.”
Oddly enough, back in the ’70’s I was working in a lab where pemoline was being tested – we all played with it, but it was pretty “meh” IMHO – there are far better nootropics today….One person at the lab DID have some odd GI side effects….

I recently bought nine different kinds of nootropics from Peak Nootropics. I’m planning to divide them into three stacks, cycling each stack for a month. This is how I’ll stack them:
STACK A: Oxyracetam (700mg 2x/day), Aniracetam (600mg 3x/day), Alpha-GPC (200mg 3x/day), Acetyl L-Carnitine (300mg 3x/day), Salbutamine (300mg 3x/day)
STACK B: Pramicetam (200mg 2x/day), Alpha-GPC (250mg 2x/day), Acetyl L-Carnitine (400mg 2x/day), L-Theanine (120mg 2x/day)
STACK C: Noopept (20mg 2x/day), Citicholine (250mg 2x/day), Acetyl L-Carnitine (400mg 2x/day), L-Theanine (120mg 2x/day)
Please advice if this is the best idea. Comments and advice on adjustments will be highly appreciated. Thank you.

Hey Joseph,
Your stacks look good though I would start with a lower dose of Oxiracetam and Aniracetam in Stack A. Since they’re synergistic, taking half of that dose to start should give you good results and then you can titrate and increase the dose once you’ve gauged the stack’s effectiveness.

I bought Alpha-GPC from Peak Nootropics 4 months ago and was using it since then. The texture changed and the alpha GPC turned into liquid. Is this considered expired already? Will it do harm to me if I continue taking it?
One more thing, I recently had headaches after waking early in the morning. Does my nootropics have anything to do with my headaches? I understand that I might have headaches after taking some nootropics, but I cant find the relationship of that since Im having headaches after waking up and not during the day when I am taking these:

Hey Paul,
It’s always best to look at the specific interactions and synergistic effects of different supplement combinations. This is true to both prevent side effects and to improve positive effects.
It’s difficult to make comparisons between supplements that have different mechanisms of action, unless a specific comparative study has been published. For example, there have been studies published comparing the effects of Piracetam vs. Aniracetam or Piracetam vs. Oxiracetam, but there haven’t been studies comparing Piracetam vs. Ginkgo Biloba and the like.
In any event, supplements will affect everyone differently and you may have very different effects from what others have experienced. So you can use these ratings as a guide to see what others have experienced, but your results may vary :).

“Many users report degradation of alpha-GPC when stored openly or for long periods of time. Alpha-GPC is hygroscopic and will pull moisture in from the surrounding air. This will cause the powder to turn into what appears to be a gel. Alpha-GPC with >99% purity will undergo this process at a visible rate (seconds to minutes) and thus requires minimized exposure to the air. This hygroscopic quality can cause gel capsules not fully packed with alpha-GPC to dissolve. Proper storage methods need to be used with alpha-GPC and include removing all air from the container, double bagging with plastic bags rated for chemicals (less likely to leak air), and storing bulk/excess inside the freezer. Vacuum sealed bags are highly recommended. For people accessing alpha-GPC daily it is advisable to separate a month’s supply from excess and storing the excess as best as possible. Vacuum sealing a large supply into many 1 month dividends is a method positively reported by many users. It is important to note that hygroscopy is not degradation and leaves the substance still usable, however, the ability to accurately weigh a dose is no longer possible as the substance being weighed will be a mixture of powder and water. Liquefied or gelled alpha-GPC may also be indicative of poor storage and thus have an increased likelihood of actual degradation.[citation needed]”
