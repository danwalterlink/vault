You can think of anxiety as a kind of tension, like stretching a rubber band. Compulsive behavior alleviates this tension. Slightly painful stimuli also triggers the release of endorphins, reinforcing the behavior.

You know how people with autism-spectrum disorders (ASDs) sometimes do something weird over and over again? This is called 'stimming'. And it's a very nice topic with which to explore anxiety.

What is anxiety, really? It seems like a simple question, but it has taken researchers quite the effort to really put the nail in the coffin. A popular idea today is that anxiety is about unpredictability.

[One of the main purposes (some say it's the sole purpose) of having a brain is to predict what will happen next.](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/WhateverNext.PredictiveBrainsSituatedAgentsFutureCogSci.AClark2012.pdf) Through your sensory receptors, you get a constant stream of patterns that are eventually transduced into the form of action potentials. These patterns travel to your neocortex, where higher-order patterns are extracted. Well, it's actually more advanced than that. Even your retinae extracts higher-order patterns from the patterns of photons they receive. But it's in the neocortex the interesting thing happens. When groups of neurons receive patterned information in the form of action potentials, they try to predict the rest of the sequence based on what they have already received. The discrepancy between the prediction and the actual input is known as the "prediction error". One of the key activities of your brain is to minimize prediction errors, in effect prediciting what will happen next.

When predictions fail, you have a certain degree of uncertainty. Norepinephrine from your locus coeruleus in your brain stem keeps track of these errors and send a global message to most of your brain about the unexpected uncertainty. I say *unexpected* uncertainty, because there is also an *expected* form of uncertainty. When you flip a coin you don't know whether it will be heads or tails, but either outcome won't surprise you. Acetylcholine is used to account for this form of uncertainty. If you didn't have acetylcholine, you'd end up in a really weird state. Your brain would "think" that your predictions are all wrong, and form new predictions all the time, making your experience very unstable. You'd hallucinate. Acetylcholine stabilizes your experience so you won't be confused. You could argue that it oversimplifies your experience in a way that allows you to deal with life in a more efficient manner. [Source.](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/%7Edayan/papers/ydnips02.pdf)

So what do you do if you're overwhelmed by the unexpected form of uncertainty? You could do something very repetitive, in effect decreasing the level of uncertainty. You *know* what will happen next, because you're doing the same thing over and over again. [Here's an article linking this to autism.](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00302/abstract)

[There was a paper out in 2013 that argued that positive emotions are those that lead to a decrease of uncertainty, while negative emotions are those that to an increase of uncertainty.](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003094) This would suggest that the minor self-destructive behaviors related to anxiety is about momentarily being able to decrease levels of uncertainty.

You can get a more in-depth understanding of the psychological mechanisms behind this process by reading [this paper](http://www.yorku.ca/mar/Hirsh%20et%20al%20in%20press_PsychRev_Entropy%20Model%20of%20Uncertainty.pdf).

I was hoping someone would give us a predictive coding explanation. Nice answer.

So cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) preach the benefits of meditation and controlled breathing.

Basically, you just focus on your breathing for an extended period of time (10-15 minutes) in order to "live in the now".

Anxiety is a lot about thinking about the future, and obsessing about how things will play out. This makes a lot of sense.

This makes me wonder if people who are more intelligent or well informed are more likely to experience anxiety. I imagine that, following this model, knowing that the world simply can't be reduced down to patterns or that there is simply more out there that you know you aren't accounting for could increase anxiety. Similarly, being less well informed or less intelligent could lead to less anxiety, in an ignorance is bliss sort of way.

This is an interesting idea but I'm not sure if I totally buy it.

Am I really biting my nails because my mind craves the certainty of performing a known action? Because from my perspective, it feels much more pathological. The rough edges of my nails fundamentally *bother* me. There's a sense of compulsive duty about it. Like it's my job.

I think maybe a related explanation that makes sense is that we are occupying our concern with something direct and easy to avoid having to think about things that stress us out. It's much less stressful to focus your attention on biting your nails or playing a video game than it is to think about your future. Almost like we are tricking our brains into thinking we are productive without having to actually engage with things that cause us psychological pain.

Yeah, there's another facet to this, but I didn't include it because I thought it was advanced enough as it was. Also, the question was about anxiety, so I thought I'd stick to that topic.

Dopamine is also involved.

The basal ganglia is responsible for habit-formation, and dopamine is used to create habits. In my answer I mentioned prediction errors. Dopamine is used to calculate the expected reward of your actions. When you do something that results in a better outcome than expected, your behavior is reinforced, increasing the likelihood that you will respond in the same way in the future. A leading theory of dopamine suggests that it signals reward prediction error (RPE), and that this is a very important learning signal.

In the striatum (where we find the basal ganglia) there is a direct dopaminergic pathway, and an indirect dopaminergic pathway. It is believed by some researchers that the direct pathway is responsible for learning by positive outcomes (better than expected), while the indirect pathway is responsible for learning by negative outcomes (worse than expected). It has also been suggested that low levels of dopamine cause the indirect pathway to exert a stronger influence over behavior, leading to a tendency to avoid stressful situations rather than engage in goal-directed behavior.

So in a sense low levels of dopamine make escapism very rewarding. This could be part of the reason why methylphenidates (e.g Adderall) improve your focus. The cries of the indirect pathway to avoid your homework and bite your nails while watching Netflix are drowned out by the direct pathway seeking to engage in goal-directed behavior.

The more I learn about all this, the more I think I may legitimately have some chemical imbalances in my brain that deviate significantly from the norm. Uncertainty stresses me out to an irrational degree, and I find it very difficult to approach situations I am uncertain about unless I don't have a choice. Additionally even if I rationally know the rewards of doing something difficult or undesirable are well worth the effort (and have done so before, e.g. getting work/studying done early) I feel no real motivation to push for those goals until it reaches a point of "do or fail". Even stuff I do regularly that shouldn't stress me out (like running errands) is like this and I'll put things off for weeks if I can.

I'm in graduate school now, but only because I was able to rationally decide during periods of calm in my life that I should commit to the activities required to get to this point (sign up for difficult classes, fill out applications for internships/schools, etc.) and then use my fear of failure to motivate the execution of whatever it is I need to do, rather than desire for success.

It sucks and I really hope that effective ways to address these types of habits are developed so that people similar to me don't have to live life this way. If I didn't have other personality traits that allow me to compensate, such as stubbornness and the ability to dig into and break apart difficult problems, I am fairly certain I'd be in a very different situation at this point in my life. That scares me and makes me sad to think about others who are less fortunate.

This was a very well written, and informative explanation. I'm actually going to share this with /r/crazyhand (a subreddit focused on helping users learn to play the super smash brothers game series at a competitive level). We get a lot of questions focused on dealing with stress and tournament nerves, and I feel like your description may be able to help a number of our users both new and experienced in the competitive scene.

No answer, but in addition to these small physical self destructive tendancies, I've also found my anxiety to manifest in more sinister ways: binge drinking, poor nutrition, insane procrastination (the more anxious I am / stuff I have to do, then paradoxically, the more likely I am to procrastinate.)

I think it's nonsense, but Freud's take on this was at the very least interesting. He thought self-destructive behavior was caused by an inherent "[death drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive)" - a longing to return to the safety of the womb. When the pressures of the world are great, this becomes especially pronounced as we subconsciously seek out shelter from our suffering and burdens.
