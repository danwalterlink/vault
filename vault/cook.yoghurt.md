(image/png)

## Temperature & Homemade Yogurt

If you’ve come to love store-bought yogurt but not the price, it might be time to [make your own yogurt at home](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/how-to-make-yogurt), and for a fraction of the cost. At Cultures for Health, we carry several varieties of yogurt starter that require heat to culture. These include:

If you [choose a yogurt starter](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/choosing-a-yogurt-starter-culture) that requires heat to culture (such as store-bought yogurt or a thermophilic starter culture above) you may also decide to purchase a [yogurt maker](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/kitchen-appliances/yogurt-makers.html) to incubate the milk and starter. However, there are many ways to culture yogurt without a yogurt maker.

## Test The Temperature

For best results using one of the alternative methods below, it is helpful to **test the temperature** of the method you choose to use **before** making yogurt.

You want to make sure that the container you are using is **holding the correct temperature** range for the **length of time needed** to culture your yogurt.

To do this, **pour 110ºF water** into a container and take temperature readings **every 30 minutes to 1 hour.** If the temperature does not fluctuate, you are ready to go. If you see dramatic changes in temperature, **adjust** your container as needed or try another method.

## 10 YOGURT CULTURING ALTERNATIVES

The following is a list of yogurt culturing alternatives, intended to give you ideas for how to culture yogurt without a yogurt maker.

### 1. Food Dehydrator

A box-style food dehydrator, with shelves removed and its door open/closed, works well to maintain the required temperature.

Once you've heated the milk and added the yogurt starter, pour it into jars or a culturing container and place into the food dehydrator to culture.

### 2. Folding Proofer

The [Folding Proofer](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/brod-taylor-folding-proofer.html) can be set to the temperature required for culturing yogurt. To use this, simply **arrange your jars of milk and starter in the proofer.**

- If you don't plan to fill the proofer completely with jars, keep the jars **close to the edges** of the proofer.
- If you fill your proofer completely with jars, plan to **rotate your jars** a few times while they are culturing to produce more even results.

### 3. Oven

The **pilot light in a gas oven** may add enough warmth to culture yogurt that requires heat.

In an electric oven, a **candle or the oven light** may keep the environment warm enough to culture thermophilic yogurt.

Before trying this method, be sure to **test the oven temperature** with a jar of water and thermometer.

Setting your yogurt jars on a **baking pan** will help give them stability on the oven racks.

Last but not least, don't forget to **leave a note on the oven** - you wouldn't want your yogurt to get cooked if someone preheats the oven for cooking!

### 4. Thermos

An insulated container such as a beverage thermos or the [YogoTherm](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/yogotherm-yogurt-incubator.html) maintains temperature **without electricity**.

A **glass** or **stainless steel** thermos works well for this method. You'll want to **avoid using soft plastic**, which can scratch easily and allow unwanted bacteria to linger, as well as **avoid using abrasive cleaners** on the thermos.

Ambient temperature can have an effect on the culturing process; in cold weather, **wrap** thermos or Yogotherm with a warmed towel for **added insulation**.

### 5. Crockpot

Crockpots are a kitchen wonder for cooking and they can be super helpful when making yogurt at home too! Using a crockpot to make yogurt allows the preparation and culturing of milk to take place in **one vessel**. (Greek and Bulgarian starters should not be activated using the crockpot method). Check out the [crockpot method](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/how-to-make-yogurt-in-crock-pot) to learn how!

### 6. Insulated Cooler and Water

Place yogurt jars in an insulated cooler, pouring **105º-115ºF water** inside, about **¾ of the way up** the jars. Close lid tightly, covering the cooler in a **blanket or towel**. Change out water if temperature drops below **105ºF**.

### 7. Insulated Cooler and Heating Pad

**Place** yogurt jars in an insulated cooler with a **heating pad set to low atop the jars.** Close the cooler lid and let the cord hang out. You can also wrap cooler with a blanket or towel for added insulation.

### 8. Insulated Cooler in the Sun

You can take advantage of the heat during the **hot summer months** by culturing outside. (Think of the counter space you'll be freeing up too!) Simply set your yogurt jars in a **closed cooler** and then **set it in the sun**.

### 9. Hot Water Bath

Set the covered yogurt jar in a large bowl, filling the bowl with **heated water**. The water level should be no more than one to two inches from the top of the jar.

As the water cools, remove the jar _gently_, pour the water out, then replace the jar, and add new heated water.

### 10. Counter Top Yogurt Starters

If none of the above methods works for you, try one of our **counter top yogurt starters**, which culture at **70-77°F**. Our counter top yogurt starter cultures include: [Viili](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/viili-yogurt-starter.html), [Filmjolk](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/filmjolk-yogurt-starter.html), [Piima](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/piima-yogurt-starter.html), and [Matsoni](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/matsoni-yogurt-starter.html).
