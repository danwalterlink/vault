Easy Flaked Almond “Tuna” Salad
#### Ingredients:

* 1 cup (155 g) raw almonds, soaked
* 1 celery stalk (80 g), finely chopped
* 2 green onions (30 g), finely chopped
* 1 garlic clove (6 g), minced
* 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 mL) vegan mayo, to taste
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 2 to 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon fine grain sea salt, or to taste
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* Pinch of kelp granules (optional, lends a "fishy" flavour)

#### Directions:

1. Soak almonds in a bowl of water for 3-9 hours until plump. Drain and rinse well.
2. Add drained almonds into a food processor (there's no need to peel the almond skins unless you want to) and process until finely chopped. It should look a bit like flaked tuna. Place into a medium mixing bowl.
3. Add the chopped celery, green onion, garlic, mayo, mustard, and lemon into the bowl. Stir well to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add a pinch of kelp granules if desired.
4. Serve on top of a salad or lettuce wrap, or in a sandwich or wrap. Refrigerate leftover salad for up to 3 days.
