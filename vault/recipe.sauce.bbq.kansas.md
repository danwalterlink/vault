kansas BBQ sauce
## HOMEMADE BBQ SAUCE

In my humble Kansas City opinion, this really is the best homemade BBQ sauce recipe! It’s sweet, it’s tangy, it’s smoky, and it’s perfect on just about everything. It is also naturally vegan and gluten-free (*see note below).

**TOTAL TIME:** 30 MINS



**PREP TIME:** 5 MINS

**COOK TIME:** 25 MINS

### INGREDIENTS:

* 1 (15 oz.) can tomato sauce
* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1/3 cup honey or agave nectar
* 1/4 cup tomato paste
* 1/4 cup molasses
* 3 Tbsp. worcestershire*
* 2 tsp. liquid smoke**
* 1 tsp. smoked paprika
* 1 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp. freshly-ground black pepper
* 1/2 tsp. onion powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* (optional: a few pinches of cayenne powder for extra heat, which I recommend)

### DIRECTIONS:

Whisk all ingredients together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer (uncovered) for 20 minutes, or until the sauce has slightly thickened.

Use the sauce immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 1 week.

*If you are making this sauce vegan, be sure to find a brand of worcestershire sauce that is vegan. I recommend Annie’s.

**If you are making this sauce gluten-free, be sure to find a brand of liquid smoke that is certified GF. I recommend Wright’s or Colgin.
