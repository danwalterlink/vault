YearOverview:
Repetition is the basis of structure. 361 days encompasses this handy planning tool. Since our time is recurrently defined in 7 day periods, and follows this rhythm, we won’t oppose it. Accuracy of thought overrides other parameters, thus getting to the perfectly rectangular shape. Take your biggest 3 yearly projects and designate them with shorthand letters, placing the respective letter in a appropriate box. Take the important substeps and mark them slightly differently on other days, until you reach the lowest branches of your todo-tree. This type of planning is often referred to as: reverse planning. This form of planning gives you an overview of the year to come, and really shows how special each day is. It doesn’t look like much in this grid. Yet, humans tend to overestimate what they can achieve in a day, and underestimate what they can do in a year. If you don’t feel a sense of urgency, maybe your goals are not big enough. It is not necessary to color each and every single day; mark your smallest keystones of the project with for example gradually smaller letters, different colors or whatever suits you best. Daily tasks and rituals should be exempted from this list; this is purely for forward looking projects, so we aren’t even dealing with proper days here, but mere snippets of them. I advise to loosely partition the day in 3 parts, observe where you function best, put all important things in there and let the day fade out naturally. Integrated rituals, spaced around the day help to structure it, and get you on track with often neglected smaller habits with stringing them together, starting with a small one. This, and more, will be on the “habitStringsTemplate” sheet.
