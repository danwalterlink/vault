maieutechne

most clients I receive, female and orthodactic
issue:
societal that "women train differently"? Lots of preconceived notions of "correctness".
not enough stimulus, slow to no progression

"more work" doesn't work
get them to do more complex work similar to what was already done

define progression goals to/from motion with time-horizon
