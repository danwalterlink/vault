   cat file1                       # list file1 to screen
   cat file1 file2 file3 > outfile # add files together into outfile
   cat \*.txt > outfile             # add all .txt files together
   cat file1 file2 | grep fred     # pipe files
3. cc - Compile a C program

    gtar czf out.tar.gz dir1 # write compressed tar, out.tar.gz
    gtar tf in.tar          # list contents of in.tar
    gtar tzf in.tar.gz      # list contents of compressed in.tar.gz
    gtar xf in.tar          # extract contents of in.tar here
    gtar xzf in.tar.gz      # extract compressed in.tar.gz
    gtar xf in.tar file.txt ... # extract file.txt from in.tar
16. gv - View a Postscript document with Ghostscript.
17. gzip / gunzip - GNU Compress files into a smaller space, or decompress .Z or .gz files.

    program | gunzip > out  # decompresses compressed program output
18. info - A documentation system designed to replace man for GNU programs (e.g. gtar, gcc). Use cursor keys and return to go to sections. Press b to go back to previous section. A little hard to use.

    info gtar               # documentation for gtar
19. kill - Kill, pause or continue a process. Can also be used for killing daemons.

    > ps -u jss
    > ...
    >  666  pts/1        06:06:06  badprocess 
    > kill 666        # this sends a \`\`nice'' kill to the
    >
    > ```
    >               # process. If that doesn't work do
    > ```
    >
    > kill -KILL 666   # (or equivalently)

20. latex - Convert a tex file to dvi
21. logout - Closes the current shell. Also try \`\`exit''.
22. lp - Sends files to a printer

    lp file.ps  # sends postscript file to the default printer
    lp -dlp2 file.ps           # sends file to the printer lp2
    lp -c file.ps    # copies file first, so you can delete it
    lpstat -p lp2         # get status and list of jobs on lp2
    cancel lp2-258                  # cancel print job lp2-258 

    lpr -Plp2 file.ps                    # send file.ps to lp2
    lpq -Plp2                        # get list of jobs on lp2
    lprm -Plp2 1234                   # delete job 1234 on lp2
23. ls - Show lists of files or information on the files

    ls file     # does the file exist?
    ls -l file  # show information about the file
    ls \*.txt    # show all files ending in .txt
    ls -lt      # show information about all files in date order
    ls -lrt     # above reversed in order
    ls -a       # show all files including hidden files
    ls dir      # show contents of directory
    ls -d dir   # does the directory exist?
    ls -p       # adds meaning characters to ends of filenames
    ls -R       # show files also in subdirectories of directory
    ls -1       # show one file per line
24. man - Get instructions for a particular Unix command or a bit of Unix. Use space to get next page and q to exit.

    man man      # get help on man
    man grep     # get help on grep
    man -s1 sort # show documentation on sort in section 1
25. more - Show a file one screen at a time

    more file                # show file one screen at a time
    grep 'frog' file | more  # Do it to output of other command
26. mv - Move file(s) or rename a file

    mv file1 file2                     # rename file1 to file2
    mv dir1 dir2                       # rename directory dir1 to dir2
    mv file1 file2 file3 ... directory # move files into directory
27. nano - very simple text editor. Warning - this program can introduce extra line breaks in your file if the screen is too narrow!
28. nice - Start a process in a nice way. Nice levels run from -19 (high priority) to 19 (low priority). Jobs with a higher priority get more CPU time. See renice for more detail. You should probably be using the grid-engine to run long jobs.

    nice +19 myjob1   # run at lowest priority
    nice +8 myjob2    # run at lowish priority
29. openoffice.org - a free office suite available for Linux/Unix, Windows and Mac OS X.
30. passwd - change your password
31. pine - A commonly used text-based mail client. It is now called alpine. Allows you to send and receive emails. Configuration options allow it to become quite powerful. Other alternatives for mail are mozilla mail and mutt, however I suggest you stick to alpine or thunderbird.
32. printenv - Print an environment variable in tcsh

    setenv MYVARIABLE Fred
    printenv MYVARIABLE
    printenv # print all variables
33. ps - List processes on system

    > ps -u jss          # list jss's processes
    >   934 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
    > ^^^^^ ^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^
    > PID   output   CPU time name
    > ps -f      # list processes started here in full format
    > ps -AF     # list all processes in extra full format
    > ps -A -l            # list all processes in long format
    > ps -A | grep tcsh   # list all tcsh processes
34. pwd - Show current working directory

    > pwd
    > /home/jss/writing/lecture
35. quota - Shows you how much disk space you have left

    > quota -v
    > ...
36. renice - Renice a running process. Make a process interact better with other processes on the system (see top to see how it is doing). Nice levels run from -19 (high priority) to 19 (low priority). Only your own processes can be niced and they can only be niced in the positive direction (unless you are root). Normal processes start at nice 0.

    > ps -u jss | grep bigprocess      # look for bigprocess
    >  1234 pts/0    99:00:00 bigprocess
    > renice 19 1234                   # renice PID 1234 to 19
37. rm - Delete (remove) files

    rm file1     # delete a file (use -i to ask whether sure)
    rm -r dir1   # delete a directory and everything in it (CARE!)
    rm -rf dir1  # like above, but don't ask if we have a -i alias
38. rmdir - Delete a directory if it is empty (rm -r dirname is useful if it is not empty)

    rmdir dirname
39. staroffice - An office suite providing word processor, spreadsheet, drawing package. See Users' Guide on how to install this. This is a commercial version of the openoffice office package - use openoffice.org on linux.
40. setenv - Set an environment variable in tcsh.

    setenv MYVARIABLE Fred
    echo Hi there $MYVARIABLE
41. tar - Combine files into one larger archive file, or extract files from that archive (same as gtar on Linux).

    tar cvf /dev/rmt/0 ./      # backup cwd into tape
    tar tvf /dev/rmt/0         # list contents of tape
    tar xvf /dev/rmt/0         # extract contents of tape
42. thunderbird - Start mozilla thunderbird.
43. top - Interactively show you the `top'' processes on a system - the ones consuming the most computing (CPU) time. Press the `q'' key in top to exit. Press the `k'' key to kill a particular process. Press `r'' to renice a process.
