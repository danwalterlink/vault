intention breeds tension
most basic credo in all of strength exercising: tension in the right spots so the position are good
ergo the movement quality goes through the roof

measured at how biomechanically important the muscle group is:
eg: hip flexion is a very complex movement

if 2 muscle groups compete for the same movement, the meatier and better adapted (shorter lever arm for example) should be preferred.
