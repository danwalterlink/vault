## on tempo

quantized game:
    ccgs
because, all other games, microability is a huge factor (sc2: marine-meme)
(rise of autobattlers?)

dichotomy:
tempo vs value (resources)

neglect other deck-defining construction constraints, such as
availability
ladderability (average timeToWin)
and other metagame deciding factors.

hearthstone, yugioh: entirely board-mediated
mtg, artifact: stack, but interstingly, this does not, matter, since the quantization of resources is similar enough (cards and life-points).

tempo: expenditure of resources to reduce time to achieve a victory condition
OR increase the oppenents,
mtg:
 primary wincon: reduce oppenents life total to 0
other ones later.
in short, tempo costs resources
and generating more resources costs resources.

and how do we measure how fast we are? in a mediums time, and since were in turn based games, this would be in turns.
but, the total output is limited, so we have to decide: tempo or value.

not always clearly separated, mixture of styles and unfortunately:
muddling of the word tempo.
when tempo play, we mean a tempo-focused play, in which sacrifice total resources
tempo-efficient: less resources spent than opponent (because the amount of value that can be actualized is finite).

good examples:
mono-u deck autumn burchett
known "tempo deck"

cheap evasive creatures and cheap interaction (generally tempo-based, meaning, we sacrifice resource-advantages for tempo)
get early "tempo" meaning, put our opponent under a "clock", meaning that he has the obligation to change the state of the game, otherwise he loses,
we expend resources to keep him from gaining "tempo" or reducing ours.

epitome of tempo play would be "unsummon". you sacrifice a card for your opponents mana expenditure. With clever interaction, you might even gain some value from it.
Inversely, you can use unsummon as a pure value-play, by bouncing your own creature to trigger some effect on them.

There's many references in ccgs refering to time. as I mentioned the clock

another would be a race, meaning that you forego trying to interactively change your opponents tempo, but simply try to be faster
than your mono-u opponent killing you slowly with little fliers, countering your spells.
funnily, we call this: "going the distance", metaphorically apt,
which is one way of beating a tempo deck.

another would be to "outvalue" them, which implies a focus on the total amount of resources available, but:
most common new player trap:
in ccgs, total resources almost never play a factor
 exception: secondary wincon: draw on empty library and usually positively constructed ones on cards. (mill)
but the available acceleration (meaning actualizable tempo) does, since the general victory condition achieved is the primary.
This springs up, because cards that excel at tempo plays would be plain unbalanced, would they also increase your resources.

interestinlgy, almost noone refers to sweepers as a tempo play, because the important bit is the aforegoing sacrifice of resources by the aggressor, that usually ends in the resource positive exchange for the player doing the sweeping (multiple-for-1s).
consequently, the amount of further mana-expenditure is severly limited. Thus, resource oriented decks try to win over more aggressive decks, by limiting their possibilities of accelerating, by either being more effective/efficient, or generating more resources (finding the right ones) and "turning the corner",
which implies counter-tempo. That is also the reason we have the general triad of archetypes: aggro<midrange<control<aggro...

with this definition, "approach of the second sun" is an almost pure tempo-play. which could also read:
0: enchantment. whenever you draw a card, put a card counter on you. 6w: if there are 0 sun counters and less than 7 card counters on you, gain 7 life, put a sun counter on you. Otherwise, you win the game.

in ccgs, the currency of exchange is "mana", so
There are certain ways in eg. hearthstone comp circuits to gauge a decks chance of winning, by adding all the mana value together and giving the more expensive deck the nod.
this only works, if the decks are constructed with the "metagame" in mind.
(what the existence of certain archetypes does to a format). Otherwise, a deck would assemble the most degenerate pile of value that does nothing until it has assembled its resource-machine.
Again, what isn't important is the total resources, generally; but the average impact of plays on certain turns.
more resource intensive card are generally more "efficient", because on the space of a card, you get a lot of "state"(-changes).
Conversely, by playing many cheap cards, the chances of you seizing early tempo is high, but the cards are individually less efficient or effective (synergy?).

All decks look for "efficiency" in cards, and that - in ccgs - is generally regulated through availability (aka rarity), with hearthstone having singleton legendaries in decks, and mtg restricting legendaries on board to 1, while also having effects bound to rarities, these interactions can become very deep.
