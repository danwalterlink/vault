a general note on monster stats:
the monster stats are - in my mind, of course - merely the very diverse attributes of all individual monsters generally subsumed by this label.
not every human has a strength of 10? men might have an average of 11 while women have an average of 9, but the outliers of every attribute will be very much higher.
As with every normally distributed system, the numbers close to the average will be about the same percentile to the average.
