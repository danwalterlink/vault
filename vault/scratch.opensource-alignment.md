help unify core modules between big participants and open-source developers: making core modules as open as possible.
 drawbacks? exploitability?

 linux kernel?
 shouldnâ€™t we as security-concerned developers always treat the source code as open? human based-systems are still generally easier to exploit than software.

if more people focus on the development of open source software and are paid to fix things, the incentive to build safer software rises drastically.
