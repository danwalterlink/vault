Hormones — such as estrogen, testosterone, adrenaline and insulin — are extremely important chemical messengers that affect many aspects of your overall health. Hormones are secreted by various glands and organs including your **[thyroid](https://draxe.com/8-secrets-to-cure-hypothyroidism-and-other-hormone-problems/)**, adrenals, pituitary, ovaries, testicles and pancreas. The entire endocrine system works together to control the level of hormones circulating throughout your body, and if one or more is even even slightly imbalanced it can cause widespread, major health problems.

Conventional treatments for hormonal imbalances usually include synthetic hormone replacement therapies, birth control pills, insulin injections, thyroid medications and more. Unfortunately, for the majority of people suffering from hormonal disorders, relying on these types of synthetic treatments often does three things:

1. It makes people dependent on taking prescription drugs for the rest of their lives in order to keep symptoms under control
2. It simply *masks* the patient’s symptoms, but doesn’t solve them, which means that the patient can continue to develop abnormalities in other areas of the body while the disorder progresses
3. It causes a higher risk for serious side effects such as stroke, osteoporosis, anxiety, reproductive problems, cancer and more

The good news is there are ways to balance your hormones naturally. Below you’ll learn what type of hormonal imbalance your specific symptoms might be pointing to, what the root causes of your hormonal problem are, and how you can help treat the problem without experiencing the negative side effects associated with synthetic treatments.

### **Signs & Symptoms of Hormonal Imbalances**

Some of the most common signs and symptoms of hormone imbalances include:

* **[Infertility](https://draxe.com/6-ways-to-beat-infertility/)** and irregular periods
* Weight gain or weight loss (that’s unexplained and not due to intentional changes in your diet)
* Depression and anxiety
* Fatigue
* [**Insomnia**](https://draxe.com/3-steps-to-cure-insomnia-without-drugs/)
* Low libido
* Changes in appetite
* Digestive issues
* [**Hair loss**](https://draxe.com/6-secrets-reversing-hair-loss-balancing-hormones/) and hair thinning

Symptoms of hormonal imbalances can range drastically depending on what type of disorder or illness they cause. For example, high estrogen can contribute to problems including endometriosis and reproductive issues, while [**symptoms of diabetes**](https://draxe.com/diabetes-symptoms/) often include weight gain, changes in appetite, nerve damage, and problems with eyesight.

#### Some specific problems associated with some of the most common hormonal imbalances include:

* **Estrogen dominance:** changes in sleep patterns, changes in weight and appetite, higher perceived stress, slowed metabolism
* [**Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome**](https://draxe.com/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome/) **(PCOS):** infertility, weight gain, higher risk for diabetes, acne, abnormal hair growth
* **Low estrogen:** low sex drive, reproductive problems, menstrual irregularity, changes in mood
* **Hypothyroidism:** slowed metabolism, weight gain, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, digestive issues, irregular periods
* **Low testosterone:** erectile dysfunction, muscle loss, weight gain, fatigue, mood-related problems
* **Hyperthyroidism &** [**Grave’s Disease**](https://draxe.com/graves-disease/)**:** anxiety, thinning hair, weight loss, IBS, trouble sleeping, irregular heartbeats
* **Diabetes:** weight gain, nerve damage (neuropathy), higher risk for vision loss, fatigue, trouble breathing, dry mouth, skin problems
* **Adrenal fatigue:** fatigue, muscle aches and pains, anxiety and depression, trouble sleeping, brain fog, reproductive problems

* * *

### **Risk Factors & Causes of Hormonal Imbalances**

Hormonal imbalances are multi-factorial disorders, meaning they are caused by a combination of factors such as your diet, medical history, genetics, stress levels and exposure to toxins from your environment. Some of the major contributors to hormonal imbalances include:

* Food allergies and gut issues: An expanding field of new research shows that your gut health plays a significant role in hormone regulation. If you have [**leaky gut syndrome**](https://draxe.com/4-steps-to-heal-leaky-gut-and-autoimmune-disease/) or a lack of beneficial **[probiotic](https://draxe.com/probiotic-foods/)** bacteria lining your intestinal wall, your more susceptible to hormonal problems including diabetes and obesity. That’s because inflammation usually stems from your gut and then impacts nearly every aspect of your health ([1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592668/))
* Being overweight or obese
* High levels of inflammation caused by a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle
* Genetic susceptibility
* Toxicity (exposure to pesticides, toxins, viruses, cigarettes, excessive alcohol and harmful chemicals) ([2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524969/))
* High amount of stress, and a lack of enough sleep and rest

## **10 Ways to Balance Hormones Naturall**y

**1. Eat Healthy Fats (Including Coconut Oil and Avocados)**

Eating a variety of foods high in short, medium and long-chain fatty acids is key to keeping your hormones in check. Your body needs various types of fats to create hormones, including saturated fat and cholesterol. Not only are these essential fats fundamental building blocks for hormone production, but they keep inflammation levels low, boost your metabolism and promote weight loss.

My four favorite sources of anti-inflammatory, healthy fats include: coconut oil, avocados, grass-fed butter and wild-caught salmon. [**Coconut oil uses**](https://draxe.com/coconut-oil-uses/) are plentiful− for example coconut oil (or cream/milk) has natural anti-bacterial and fat-burning effects. Avocado benefits include improving heart health, lowering inflammation, controlling your appetite and contributing to your daily intake of fiber and nutrients such as potassum.  Salmon nutrition is also impressive: it’s one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to lower inflammation and help with cognitive functions.

**2. Supplement with Adaptogen Herbs**

[**Adaptogen herbs**](https://draxe.com/7-adaptogen-herbs-to-lower-cortisol/) are a unique class of healing plants that promote hormone balance and protection the body from a wide variety of diseases, including those caused by excess stress. In addition to boosting immune function and combating stress, research shows that various adapotogens — such as ashwagandha, medicinal mushrooms, rhodiola and holy basil — can:

* Improve thyroid function ([3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9811169))
* [**Lower cholesterol naturally**](https://draxe.com/lower-cholesterol-naturally-fast/)
* Reduce anxiety and depression ([4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/))
* Reduce brain cell degeneration
* Stabilize blood sugar and insulin levels ([5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3283954/))
* Support adrenal gland functions ([6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22987912))

**3. Balance Your Intake of Omega-3 to Omega-6 Fats**

Since the early 20th century, the use of refined vegetable oils and intake of omega-6 fatty acids in our diets have skyrocketed. Because people didn’t also boost their intake of **[omega-3 foods](https://draxe.com/omega-3-foods/)** during this time period, the result has been drastically elevated omega-6 levels.  I’ve seen an onslaught of chronic diseases caused by inflammatory processes literally take over our society, and a major reason why is because of very disproportionate fatty acids in the Western modern diet.

Omega-3 fatty acids are a large component of brain-cell membranes and are important for cell-to-cell communication in the brain. Research shows that omega-3 fatty acids help protect against hippocampal neuronal loss and reduce pro-inflammatory responses. ([7](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23801244)) Research from Pennsylvania State University suggests that jumping from a ratio of 1:1 omega-3/omega-6s (the ratio our hunter-gather ancestors mostly enjoyed) to the astronomical ratio between 10:1 and 20:1 (omega-3/omega-6s) is one of the primary dietary factors causing many diseases in America. ([8](http://extension.psu.edu/health/functional-foods/health-nutrition-fact-sheets/omega-fatty-acids))

Here’s a rule of thumb: Be sure to steer clear from oils high in [**omega-6 fats**](https://draxe.com/omega-6/) (safflower, sunflower, corn, cottonseed, canola, soybean and peanut), and load up on rich sources of natural omega-3s instead (wild fish, flaxseed, chia seeds, walnuts and grass-fed animal products). I want to also mention, there is a type of omega-6 fat you want to try and get in your diet called GLA. GLA (gamma-linoleic acid) can be taken in supplement form by using evening primrose oil or borage oil, and it’s also found in hemp seeds. Studies show supplementing with GLA can support healthy progesterone levels.

**4. Improve Gut Health & Heal Leaky Gut Syndrome**

Leaky gut is a condition that not only affects your digestive tract, but also causes hormone issues. Gut problems have been found to trigger autoimmune reactions, including arthritis and thyroid disorders. ([9](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3928703/)) So what exactly is leaky gut syndrome?

When undigested food particles, like gluten for example, leak through your gut into your bloodstream, it causes [**disease-causing inflammation**](https://draxe.com/inflammation-at-the-root-of-most-diseases/) that impacts the entire body — especially glands like the thyroid which is very susceptible to heightened inflammation. Most people with leaky gut have an a deficiency of probiotics in their guts. Probiotics are healthy bacteria that can actually improve your production and regulation of key hormones like insulin, ghrelin and leptin.

Steer clear of the foods that can cause damage in your digestive system most, including: processed foods, gluten, hydrogenated oils and added sugar. The top foods and supplements that support healing leaky gut include: [**bone broth**](https://draxe.com/the-healing-power-of-bone-broth-for-digestion-arthritis-and-cellulite/), kefir, fermented vegetables, and high-fiber foods like vegetables and sprouted seeds. In addition, supplements like [**digestive enzymes**](https://draxe.com/digestive-enzymes/) and probiotics can aid in repairing your gut lining, which in turn can balance your hormones.

**5. Eliminate Toxic Kitchen, Beauty and Body Care Products**

Another way to eliminate toxins in your body is to avoid conventional body care products that are made with potentially-harmful chemicals including DEA, parabens, propylene glycol and sodium lauryl sulfate. A better alternative is to use natural products made with ingredients like essential oils, coconut oil, shea butter and castor oil. The Environmental Working Group evaluated over 72,000 products and ranked them in an easy-to-understand guide to make sure you have a resource to keep your family safe. Check out [EWG’s “Skin Deep Cosmetic Database”](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) today for recommendations for which products to use and avoid.

Another thing to consider is your use of plastic bottles, aluminum cans and containers. It’s best to replace plastic and aluminum with glass and stainless steel because of the toxic **[effects of BPA](https://draxe.com/bpa-toxic-effects/).** Another wise precaution is to switch from teflon pans to stainless steel, ceramic or cast iron, which can make a big difference in the amount of chemicals making their way into the food you prepare.

**6. Exercise (Especially Interval Training)**

One of the best all-around activities you can do for your health is high intensity interval training (HIIT) − including one of my favorite types called **[burst training](https://draxe.com/burst-training/)**. If there is a silver bullet out there to help with a sluggish metabolism, weight gain and other issues, this just might be it! Exercise in general is great for balancing hormones because it reduces inflammation, can help you maintain a healthy weight, lowers stress, helps regulate your appetite, and aids in getting better sleep.

Whether we’re talking about endorphins from a “runner’s high”, testosterone, growth hormone or insulin, HIIT and burst training can help your body regulate production and use of these hormones. Exercise can also enhance your immune system, allow your cells to take up more glucose (which lowers insulin), protect you from depression, and keep you more alert without the need for caffeine.

According to the University of Notre Dame Medical School in Sydney, “HIT is associated with increased patient compliance and improved cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes and is suitable for implementation in both healthy and ‘at risk’ populations”. ([10](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23210120))  For people with hormonal imbalances, the key with exercise is to *be careful not to overdo it.* Training for a shorter period of time (about 20 minutes three times a week) but with higher intensity works well for most people who can’t afford to add any extra stress to their system. Keep in mind that optimal exercise can differ a lot from person to person however, so it’s a good idea to seek advise from a processional if you’re ever unsure.

**7. Reduce Stress & Get More Sleep**

Unless you get 7-8 hours of sleep every night, you’re doing your body no favors. A **[lack of sleep](https://draxe.com/cant-sleep/)** or disturbing your natural circadian rhythm can be one of the worst habits contributing to a hormone imbalance. How so? Because your hormones work on a schedule! Case in point: Cortisol, the primary “stress hormone”, is regulated at midnight. Therefore, people who go to bed late never truly get a break from their sympathetic flight/fight stress response.

A lack of sleep, long-term use of corticosteroids and chronic stress are three of the biggest contributors to [**high cortisol levels**](https://draxe.com/cortisol-levels/). A report published in the *Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism* stated that “Stress can lead to changes in the serum level of many hormones including glucocorticoids, catecholamines, growth hormone and prolactin”. ([11](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079864/))

Sleep helps keep stress hormones balanced, builds energy and allows the body to recover properly. Excessive stress and poor sleep are linked with higher levels of morning cortisol, decreased immunity, trouble with work performance, and a higher susceptibility to anxiety, weight gain and depression. To maximize hormone function, ideally try to get to bed by 10 p.m and stick with a regular sleep-wake-cycle as much as possible.

**8. Watch Your Caffeine & Alcohol Intake**

Caffeine in moderate amounts might be okay for some people, but drinking too much caffeine is almost as bad as not getting enough sleep. Caffeine, which can stay in your system for up to six hours, is a chemical that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and raises your heart rate, increases alertness, and changes the way your brain produces hormones. Although [**caffeine overdoses**](https://draxe.com/caffeine-overdose/) are rare, caffeine is capable of elevating cortisol levels if it interferes with your normal sleep cycle. It might also have an impact on other stress hormones, such as adrenaline production. You’re probably aware that caffeine is addictive by nature, increases nervousness and anxiety in many people, and is linked with insomnia.

If you need a little boost during the day, try not to drink more than one–two cups. Ideally you’ll turn to **[matcha green tea](https://draxe.com/matcha-green-tea-burns-fat-and-kills-cancer/)** or tulsi tea which are much lower in caffeine. The good news is that once you’re health is back on track, small amounts of caffeine can usuallyu be toleraable, and even beneficial. Dartmouth Medical School reports that “caffeine has been shown to increase insulin levels, reduce insulin sensitivity, and increase cortisol levels. However, epidemiological studies have indicated that long-term consumption of beverages containing caffeine such as coffee and green tea is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus”. ([12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17998023))

Another important step is to watch your alcohol intake, since high levels of alcohol (above about 2-3 drinks daily) can negatively impact liver functioning. Chronic [alcohol consumption can contribute to estrogen dominance](http://alcoholrehab.com/alcoholism/hormonal-imbalance-caused-by-alcoholism/) and has been found to interfere with pancreatic functioning, increase liver disease risk, lower testosterone and contribute to anxiety and malnutrition. The liver is very important for hormonal balance and has over 500 different functions in the body! Of course it’s extremely important to quit smoking too. Studies have found that smoking interferes with normal immunological and reproductive processes. Compared with nonsmokers, moderate to heavy smokers (≥ 10 cigarettes/day) have abnormal levels of steroid metabolites and reproductive hormones that can be up to 35 percent higher than usual.  ([13](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1281267/))

**9. Supplement with Vitamin D3**

According to an article from the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*, vitamin D3’s role in promoting health is more profound than previously suspected. Researchers found that vitamin D has an impact in the following ways: ([14](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18689389))

It affects *“the* *adaptive immune system, the innate immune system, insulin secretion by the pancreatic β cell, multifactorial heart functioning and blood pressure regulation, and brain and fetal development.”*

Vitamin D almost acts like a hormone inside the body and has important implications for keeping inflammation levels low. This is why people who live in dark areas often suffer from seasonal depression and other health problems unless they supplement with vitamin D. Sunshine is really the best way to optimize vitamin D levels because your bare skin actually makes vitamin D on its own when exposed to even small amounts of direct sunlight. Most people should supplement with around 2,000 IU to 5,000 IU daily of vitamin D3 if they live in dark areas, during the winter, and on days when they’re not in the sun.

**10. Back Off Birth Control Pills**

In simplest terms, “the pill” is a type of hormone therapy that raises [**estrogen**](https://draxe.com/estrogen-epidemic-whats-in-your-water/) levels to such dangerous levels that it can cause many complications. I cannot urge you strongly enough to stop using the pill immediately, especially considering that there are many other (safer) ways to prevent pregnancy. My thoughts on taking the pill can be summed up this way: [**Just say no to birth control pills**](https://draxe.com/just-say-no-to-birth-control-pills/)! Studies show that the risks of taking them, especially long-term, can include: ([15](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2621397/))

* Breakthrough bleeding between cycles
* Increased risk of breast cancer
* Increased risk of uterine bleeding, blood clotting, heart attack and stroke
* **[Migraines](https://draxe.com/headache-remedies/)**
* Increased blood pressure
* Weight gain
* Back pains
* Mood changes
* Nausea
* Benign liver tumors
* Breast tenderness

* * *

### **Precautions When Treating Hormonal Imbalances**

In some cases, synthetic hormonal treatments (such as insulin or thyroid medication) will be necessary to treat a hormonal imbalance. However the majority of people can feel a lot better by making the lifestyle changes described above.

For people with diagnosed hormonal disorders− including type 1 or type 2 diabetes, Adrenal Insufficiency, Addison’s Disease, Graves’s Disease and Cushing’s Syndrome for example− it’s always important to speak with your doctor before discontinuing medication use. The natural treatments above can still help you overcome your illness and greatly reduce symptoms, but these recommendations shouldn’t take the place of medical supervision. Because hormone imbalances vary so widely in terms of severity of symptoms, always keep track of how you’re feeling, do your research and evaluate how you respond to different treatments.

* * *

### **Final Thoughts on Hormonal Imbalances:**

* Hormonal imbalances affect many millions of people worldwide, in the forms of common disorders like diabetes, thyroid disorders, menstrual irregularities, infertility, low testosterone and estrogen dominance
* Symptoms include feeling anxious, tired, irritable, gaining or losing weight, not sleeping well and noticing changes in your sex drive, focus and appetite
* Causes for hormonal imbalances include poor gut health, inflammation, high amounts of stress, genetic susceptibility, and toxicity
* Natural treatments include eating an anti-inflammatory diet, consuming enough omega-3s, getting good sleep, exercising and controlling stress

    Dr. Axe,

    I truly appreciate all of your articles and find them very interesting as well as inspirational. I have quite a past when it comes to infertility…too much to really get into. I do have one beautiful 5 year old boy who we conceived naturally. My last pregnancy ended at 23 weeks when I had to deliver our baby girl after not hearing her heart beat at a routine exam. I went on the pill after all of that because I couldn’t imagine being pregnant ever again. We decided this past fall that we would try again. I used clomid for one month but had side effects that were not safe, so I chose to go a more holistic route and used some herbal hormone replacements. Still no luck. This past month, I didn’t get my period until day 43. I had cramps on and off throughout the month. It has been emotionally draining waiting that long to find out if I’m pregnant, plus the pain that I’m having with cramping is quite uncomfortable. I decided to go back on the pill to regulate my cycle more than anything. I have pretty much given up on getting pregnant as I don’t want to use any drugs. Do you feel that the diet you mentioned in this article could really help regulate my period? Are there any other natural remedies I could try that would allow me to feel better? I also have been having cramping just in my left ovary area lately. Thanks so much or your help.

    I am in my early 50’s, have had a hysterectomy (one ovary remaining) and in full menopause for the last four years. I have been on Bioidentical Hormones for the past three years. In reading your article on balancing hormones through supplements and diet, do you recommend taking Bioidentical hormones also for someone in my situation?

    I have been working on self healing for my 2nd year now, after I felt my Dr. was clueless and all but killing me. My thyroid was crushed in 2003 and it has been downhill for me since. I was being treated for hypothyroid and the treatment made me feel even worse. I was having multiple skin conditions and gaining weight like crazy. I have been very trim and athletic my entire life and am an active horse owner and rider and take care of a 130 acre farm and as many as 70 animals daily. I get more than my fair share of daily exercise. Most would have a hard time keeping up with me. I have very good core strength and under this blubber belly, I have 6pack abs. I myself, went gluten free. I have a pot of bone broth on my stove at most times. I consume it daily. I drink milk kefir almost daily, consume fermented foods regularly. I eat fresh and never anything that comes in a can or box. All the food I eat is organic/grass fed/free range/fresh/seasonal/raw and most of it, I grow myself. My guts are 1000X better. All my skin conditions have cleared up. However, I am still gaining weight. I have put on 20# this winter alone. I try to get good sleep, I eat meals between the hours of 10am to 7pm. I consume very few sugar calories. I eat coconut oil and avocado daily. I am now appx. 40# over my healthy weight. I do not diet. I have created a lifestyle. I also take Ashwaganda & Boswelilia . I had a hair analysis that said my Vit. D was highly off the scale so I am not currently taking that, but I do get lots of outdoor/sunshine time. I also do not take iodine as I am fairly confident that I actually have Hashimoto’s. I get over heated very easily and seldom cold. I steer clear from the cabbage family of foods unless it is fermented. How do I lose weight instead of this slow and steady gain? I have no issues of self control when it comes to food and eating. I am basically happy in life and live with fairly low stress. All is great but this fat belly that I seem to be growing and I do not like it. I am a 55 year old. woman.

        I have Grave’s Disease and had radiation on it in 2011 to destroy my thyroid cells. Good thing is, my rapid heartbeat became normal and my anxiety got very noticeably better. Bad thing is instead of having more than enough thyroid hormones, my thyroid wasn’t able to make enough hormones. I was put on Synthroid for about a year after the radiation, which was working wonders for me. I became pregnant in October of 2012 and chose to stop my Synthroid medication because I didn’t want to be on any meds while pregnant. Of course, I had to lie to my doctor and tell her I was still taking them. Well, after 3 months of feeling GREAT and NORMAL, my blood work showed indeed, my thyroid hormones were literally perfect – right in the middle! To make a long story short, up until 3 months after I gave birth, I was in the best shape of my LIFE (didn’t work out once). I wondered….HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?? I started researching hCG and came to the conclusion that that’s what was making me lose weight and feel great! I actually LOST WEIGHT DURING MY PREGNANCY and KEPT IT OFF FOR 3 MONTHS BY DOING NOTHING! I am convinced that it was the hCG – partially due to the fact that after the “birth” effects of hCG dwindled away, I started to gain the weight back. I recently bought some hCG activator from Vitamin Shoppe and am anxious to see the results. I would HIGHLY suggest you try it.

        God bless,

        Jewel

        I would try adding in burst training 3-5 times each week. Check out my burst fit program here: [http://burstfit.com](http://burstfit.com/)

    Dear Dr. Axe — Thank you so much for all your information. Between you and Dr Isabella I’ve learned much and made many positive changes. I would, however, like to find a script and great price for HGH, feel it would help my inflammation, aging (60yoa), CFS, MTHFR, etc. Am in Western Connecticut near West Hartford. Can you help to direct me? Or to something on the Internet? Again, my sincere thanks and best regards, A A

    Hi Dr. Axe,

    I have been having a few issues with being able to have enough energy to interact with my son after work, hair loss, stress on top of stress, yeast/bv atleast once or more a month, trying to loose weight, and sweating for no reason…when I say no reason I mean during the day sitting all day at my desk my under arms look like I ran a few miles, and at night I’m drenched, have to change my clothes, and lay on a towel. I have asked my doctor numerous times to have a test done to see if I have a hormone/pH/vitamin issue with my body but she doesn’t acknowledge my question/concern. Instead i was given a referral to a dermatologist and he gave me pills to stop the sweating. That worked for a little bit but now not so much. Im 29 and all of these things are taking a toll on myself esteem (as my friends have told me recently) and I would really love to hear your thoughts and suggestions as I would like to get this under control. Oh! I forgot to mention that I have had mirena for about two years which might not be helping my situation at all.

    Hi! I’m 32 years old and was recently told that my FSH level was at 112 so they are telling me I’m going into menopause! I’ve stopped having a cycle in November! My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 3 years now! I had a miscarriage 2 years ago but since then I’ve been to every Dr, natrapath, chiropractor etc! They can’t seem to give me any answers! I’m currently on estrogen, progesterone and naltrexone. The only reason why is because I tried doing natural things to try and reduce hot flashes but they were getting so bad to the point I would get super panicky and passed out! I’m now doing a juice cleanse and hoping this will balance me out! Do you have any other suggestions? Thanks!

    Hi Dr. Axe,
    About 9 months ago I went off the ring/pill after many years of use. Previous to that, my cycle had always been extremely erratic. When I was young I was diagnosed with PCO’s. After stopping, surprisingly my cycle resumed and was more or less regular (between 30 to 35 days), something I had never experienced. About 5 months ago I started to experience lots of irregular bleeding and spotting in the second half of my cycle and it still continues. I had a d and C without any findings and my hormone levels are all in the normal range and do not show peri-menopause. I am currently 47 years old. A few months ago I went off of sugar and avoid processed food and in general I do feel good. Would you have any recommendation to help my situation?
    Thanks so much!

        It can take your body some time to normalize once stopping the pill, especially when it was used for a long period of time. I would focus on eating good proteins and healthy fats.

    Hi Dr. Axe. Love your website. I’ve been seeing a naturopath since December and have had comprehensive gut and salivary hormone tests done. I’m 23 and my estrogen levels are lower than menopausal. I haven’t had a period since March of last year. Before seeing her my gyno gave me provera and i lightly spotted but very lightly. I also have MAJOR digestive symptoms. Bloating and gas after many foods including lots of vegetables. My hair starting falling out in August everytime I shower and run my hands through it while dry. It’s thinned drastically since. This seemed to be at bay january and most of February but has gotten very very bad these last two weeks. I started taking Metsgenics Estrovera and Vitanica Pregnancy Prep feb 24th as well as GI Revive powder for leaky gut (all under naturopaths regulations). My dermatitis and hair loss have flared up majorly since. I don’t know what’s going on. This week I began drinking bone broth and am incorporating that into my diet and going Paleo for at least three weeks. What’s going on with me? I feel so so helpless and just like everhtbjng is getting worse. Is it normal for things to get worse before they get better?

    I just read your article. I have three daughter-in-laws who have varying stages of endometriosis. I know birth control pills are horrible to take, but the only options their doctors are giving them are birth control pills and surgery every few years. I would appreciate your insight.
