cursor movement gets stuck in folds #issue

#i movement/additions over folds
#i marks
  deletion/management
  crossfile navigation
  multiple marks on same line -> override?


#issue file link :gf follows literally
#b :gf file follow : follows semantic definitions in workspace
-> follow .vimrc /.nvimrc [[vim]] : full nvim-instance : different
