[Print](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/cilantro_pesto/print/)

* Prep time: 10 minutes
* Yield: About 1 cup

You can add more serrano chiles if you like things hot. A full teaspoon will give you a nice, warm pesto.

### INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups, packed, of cilantro, including stems
* 1/2 cup blanched almonds
* 1/4 cup chopped red onion
* 1/2 teaspoon chopped and seeded serrano chile
* 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
* 1/4 cup olive oil

**1 Toast the almonds:** Heat a small skillet on high heat. When the pan is hot, add the blanched almonds in a single layer. Stir with a wooden spoon. When the almonds are fragrant and start to brown, remove them from the pan.

**2 In a food processor, pulse the cilantro, almonds, onion, chile, and salt until well blended.**
