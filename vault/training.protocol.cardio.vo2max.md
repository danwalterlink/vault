establish max work output #hiit
-> hit minimum output at vo2-max, so anaerobic contribution is minimal
around 10-20% below max output, since o2 consumption plateaus

proven most efficient: billat protocol (30s at minimal vVO2:max|30s at 50% min.vVO2:max) and repeat until you can't sustain 30s minVVO2:max
