## Business Essentials

The nitty-gritty – your business name, where you’re located, what you sell, who the management team is.

* #### Business Name

    TotalTrainingTemple

* #### Start Date

    2016-01-01

* #### Product or Service

    Product and Service

* #### Business Overview

    We plan to give the fitness industry and Switzerland what they deserve: a place to develop the human potential to it's maximum, embetter human motion to it's functional best and inspire others to train like beasts. Health insurance and military costs will drop and life quality will skyrocket. Roughly 20% of the militia military would be not available due to injuries preventable by appropriate training, not to mention the boost in performance. That means: the best, cutting edge training tools designed by industry leaders and not what is "commonly accepted" and seen in fitness spas nowadays. Personalized data driven prescriptive training for very little additional fees (that is currently a realm for super-athletes). Novel around the clock accessability with a box system (everybody gets his own training equipment etc.) with very affordable payment options so you only pay for what you actually want to use.

* #### Management and Staff

    There will be 3 key roles in the System - which it surely wants to become: capital s system!

    Firstly CEO and CDO (Chief Design Officer) and CSO (Chief System Officer) which is 1 person;

    Then a CTO (Chief Training Officer), COO (Chief Organizational Officer) which also is one person

    and a HR and CFO function. Those three combined give the leaderboard of the organization.

    The roles in general seem self explanatory. The tidbits and accuracies will be figured out, once the business takes form and we segment into finer points.

    Part of the work will be subcontracted, since certain niches of require special expertise which cannot be required from the beginning of either personnel. The Officers need Vision and Grit and hopes for a better tomorrow, since our plans are gamechangeingly huge. We want to change Switzerland from the ground up; maybe even other countries.
