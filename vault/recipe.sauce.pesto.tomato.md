Chicken Breading (optional)*

* 1/2 cup flour
* 1 teaspoon dry basil
* 1/2 tsp EACH salt, garlic pwdr, onion pwdr, dried oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper

Sundried Tomato Pesto

* 1 cup sun-dried tomatoes, drained of oil
* 1 cup fresh basil leaves
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley
* 4 garlic cloves, peeled
* 1 shallot, peeled
* 1/4 cup pine nuts
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 tsp EACH red pepper flakes, dried oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* 1 tablespoon flour

Creamy Sauce

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 squash, sliced and quartered
* 1 green bell pepper, chopped
* 1 cup low sodium chicken broth
* 1/2 cup heavy cream mixed with 2 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1 cup milk
* 1 14.5 oz can fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 1 tablespoon sugar

1. Pasta: Cook the pasta al dente in generously salted water
    
2. Chicken (optional) : Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil (for easy cleanup) and place a cooking rack on top; lightly spray cooking rack with cooking spray.
    
3. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Combine Chicken Breading ingredients in a bowl/shallow dish then dredge chicken breasts in mixture. Tap off any excess flour then add chicken to skillet and cook until golden brown on one side, 3-5 minutes. Flip and cook chicken until the other side is golden, 2-3 minutes, then transfer chicken to prepared cooking rack and finish baking in the oven, 5-7 minutes, or until cooked through (cooking time will depend on size and thickness of chicken). Broil chicken until crispy, flip chicken, top with Parmesan cheese and broil until cheese is golden.
    
4. Creamy Sundried Tomato Pesto Sauce: Meanwhile, add Sundried Tomato Pesto ingredients to a food processor and process until well blended. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add Sundried Tomato Pesto and saute for 4 minutes. Add bell pepper and squash and saute an additional minute.
    
5. Stir in chicken broth until well incorporated then stir in heavy cream/cornstarch slurry, milk, fire roasted tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and sugar. Bring sauce to a boil then reduce to simmer until thickened and vegetables are crisp-tender.
    
6. Stir in cooked pasta. Add additional milk to reach desired consistency (optional). Taste and add additional salt, pepper, red pepper to taste.
    
7. Top with chicken and serve.
