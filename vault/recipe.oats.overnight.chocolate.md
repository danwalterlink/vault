Most of you know how much I love my overnights (ok, I am borderline obsessed with them) so I decided to create a festive one to eat during the holidays.  Maybe these will help satisfy our cravings for actual gingerbread?  Maybe?  Or…we could have these overnight oats AND a small piece of gingerbread.  That’s a good compromise, right?

One thing I have learned through the years is that all protein powders are not created equally.  I always tell my clients that many of the protein powders in the grocery store are packed with unnecessary fillers, preservatives and artificial sweeteners. Pure protein powders are very hard to find, until now!  ALOHA is made with whole foods naturally rich in nutrients and contains 18 grams of plant-based protein.  I love that this doesn’t contain whey protein for those with milk allergies.  ALOHA has a complete amino acid profile,  no added chemical amino acids, vitamins, or minerals and  no “natural” or artificial flavors, artificial sweeteners, or fillers. It’s also vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, non-GMO and dairy-free.  Now THAT’S what I am looking for in a high-quality protein powder!
