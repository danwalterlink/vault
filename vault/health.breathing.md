generally:
  less breathing
  nasal breathing

prebÃ¶tzinger-complex - rhythmic breathing

the brain - by regulating breating - can regulate its own excitability

- over-exhaling CO2 excites
general overbreathing -> hyperexcitable :
  breathing - pauses

learn -> inhale!

CO2 regulates oxygen uptake-regulation
## CO2-tolerance-test
  10s breathing normally
  - inhale as deeply as you can
  - deliberately exhale as slowly as possible
  20s - low : ...4
  30s - med : 5...6
  50s - high: 7...10
  -> improve : ^box-breathing

## practices
### box-breathing
  in X, hold X, out X, hold X

MED: breathing practices <Brief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal: https://bit.ly/3KgN5rj>

### cyclic sigh
  nasally: in X , in Y; out mouth: X
  #### physiological sigh
  -> one rep = physiological sigh
  easiest & fastest way decrease autonomic arousal
5min #practice
3 reps -> relieve side pain

triple sigh:: out:nose -> getting rid of hiccups

### hyperventilation
