## ddublu
  streamOfConsciousness - filter task
  noted thought
associate task - orgmode
  gather in task nod/te

## functions
  move focus to topmost window to {{motion}} -> similar to window/pane/tmux/vim nesting navigation behaviour

### vscode
#### dendron
  autologging - timed autocommit on significant actions -> #issue compute significance
    memory | significance | computability

systemwide - define INTENT -> informs workflows

#feature history -> eg. tab

#feature semantic commit - squash to intent
-> automated autosave commits get squashed

implementation dendron plugins
implement touchbar/pad into workflows
  -> selection tmux panels

keyboard - space while holding non-modifiers repeats held inputs
  chords in karabiner? #os.mac
  -> implementation difficulty
  check: current karabiner implementation

- [ ] [[tmux]]
- tmux: attach to pane

#f #flow adding symbols to keyboard
