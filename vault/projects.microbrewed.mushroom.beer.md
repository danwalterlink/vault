Microbrewed mushroom beer
 Cost

The key to a great beer recipe is that it is not only simple but affordable too. The mushrooms you add are a key part of this, so use them efficiently and effectively. Don’t just pour a slurry of freshly blended shiitake mushrooms directly into your wort or finished beer and expect an award-winning brew. To minimize costs, use powdered mushrooms or an extract. You will use substantially less to achieve the same end product than you would with larger pieces in bulk form.

## **Mushroom-Infused Beer Recipes**

Below you’ll find some basic beer recipes that incorporate mushrooms. Each recipe is sized to make 5 gallons of beer. However, given the broad range of ingredients available to homebrewers, you don’t have to limit yourself to the ingredients you see here. You can modify any existing recipe. Just be sure to formulate your beer to balance sweetness and bitterness. And consider making it a specialty regional beverage that incorporates local and organically grown ingredients. Have fun making your first mushroom beer, and “hopfully” many more!

### *Turkey Tail Ale*

A golden pale ale with turkey tail (Trametes *versicolor)*

* 6 pounds extra-light malted grain
* 4 ounces fresh or 2 ounces dried turkey tail mushrooms
* 1 ounce hops
* Ale yeast

### *Iceman Amber*

An amber ale with birch polypore (Piptoporus *betulinus)* and amadou (Fomes *fomentarius)*

* 6 pounds extra-light malted grain
* 1 pound amber malt
* 12 ounces carrot juice (preferably organic)
* 4 ounces fresh or 2 ounces dried birch polypore mushrooms
* 4 ounces fresh or 2 ounces dried amadou mushrooms
* 1 ounce hops
* Ale yeast

### *Reishi Red*

A natural red lager with reishi (Ganoderma spp.)

* 6 pounds extra light malted grain
* 1 pound amber malt
* 12 ounces red beet juice (preferably organic)
* 4 ounces fresh or 2 ounces dried reishi mushrooms
* 1 ounce hops
* Ale yeast

### *Agarikon Stout*

A dark, earthy brew with agarikon (Laricifomes *officinalis, Fomitopsis officinalis)*

* 1 pound chocolate malted grain
* 1 pound crystal malted grain
* 5 pounds pale malted grain
* 2 ounces liquid agarikon mushroom extract (from colonized grain)
* 1 ounce hops
* Trappist yeast

Note: Agarikon is endangered and should not be harvested in the wild, but it is a powerful medicinal mushroom worthy of a stout beer. Since this mushroom cannot be cultivated in large quantities and the mycelium is slow to grow, the best option for this recipe is to allow myceliated cakes to supercolonize over the course of several months, until they are thick with biomass, and then prepare an extract from them.
