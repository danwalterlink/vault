'prestige classes' are attained by either multiclassing, joining cults, bands or other likeminded gatherings able to impart skills and/or knowledge or gathering experience from otherwise eldritch entities.

sorcerer changes:
    'overexerting' spellslots: any non-int based caster can overexert their use of magic, either making a spell more powerful, thus using 2 slots (equivalent of casting it a spellslot higher) or temporarily casting a spell they         know, even if they have no spellslots available. an overexertion gives you a negative spellslot until your next long rest and exerts your character by spell level - spell level with minimum of 1.
    'fit of insight' cha/wis based spellcasters, on a natural 20 on the roll, get to add metamagic to their spell.

planecrash sub/prestigeclasses [typecast {cast class}]: taking experience from other classes and change eg. saving throws, proficiency boni etc., can add a subclass to a main class whenever multiclassing] can subclass feature whenever a class becomes higher than all others, thus being the main class.

        battlefield: 'what is more nature to mortals than the call of the hunt.'
        blight (abyss-changed landscapes); 'what is, grows; and we with it.'
bard:
    traceur: (postmodernist, searching for applied meaning and meta-stories told in many lands and many variations.
        two main factions: anti-nihilists: only because we are driven by non-caring nature and evolution does not make our stories less meaningful. we just        have to make the meaning ourselves (nietzsche's army of metaphors)
    analyst: every myth is just another version of a story a civilization tells itself. every story of creation is false.
