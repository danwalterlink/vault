#developing gameplans
as someone practiced, practice becomes practice

ultimate goal: progress from 'mashing' towards intentionality
-0 underlying understanding of the game-mechanics
  built upon ingame-examples
-1 identifying gameplay-elements (GE)
-2 categorizing GEs, Sequences and Situations
-3 chunkable, practiceable, meaningful difference -> divergence of concept
-4 convergence of motion -> building patterns, making them smaller, more efficient
-5 refine complex ideas through specifics (ie. spacing in matchups)
