## common logical connectives
#t adding keyboard layers : extended logical symbols
negation, not : ¬, N (prefix), ~
conjuntion, and : ^ & ∙
disjunction, or : key
Material implication (if...then) : → , C (prefix), ⇒ , ⊃
Biconditional, xnor, bi-implication iff(if and only if): ↔ , E (prefix), ≡ , =

->

if...then	(material implication) | "→" | IMPLY
...if	(converse implication) | "←" |
if and only if	(biconditional) | "↔" | XNOR
not both	(alternative denial) | "↑" | NAND
neither...nor	(joint denial) | "↓" | NOR
but not	(material nonimplication) | "↛" | NIMPLY
