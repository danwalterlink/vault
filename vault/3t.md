## mvp
clean, user-driven, swipe-first training planner

0. movement hierarchies
  restricted selection
  : movement classes
  sensible design -> touch-devices
  |> swipeable/dialable treelikes
  |> "globe-scroll" views
  -> top/overview
  -> l|r::r:specific,l:general
  case::test: generate/differentiate protocols on-the-fly (from new, or past "template")
1. session - phase - cycle
  planning tools based on past:
    choice
    variance (meaningful)
    performance
  habit-forming, geared towards building plans
  easy to form variations based on past session
  -> variations don't count as different entities
2. real-time analysis tools (futures)

flow:
swiping down: next (viewable suggestion)
  suggest (basic plan) : "steer": altering movements
  force-press/hold: differentiate

swiping up: previous
force-swipe-up: overview

left/right higher/lower movement hierarchy
force l/r variation

### models
movement
  class

session

### views
base view
  last session
  most completed movement

### flows
0. starting training from scratch
1. from template
2. generate movement session from simpler variations
