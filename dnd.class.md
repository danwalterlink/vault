"action surge becomes a general feature -> [[]]
if you dont want feature to be readily accessible through multiclassing/trait doctoring, make it an amalgam feature (features that exist through layering if class features) and describe the fantasy/surrounding ideas through the closest (sub)class

## template

  +1 per level, up to:
  4 for minor, 3 for medior (2 for 5th level) and 1 for major spells
  epic levels: slot restriction is raised to 3 for 5th, and 2 for major spells. backfill +1 slot per level.
action economy: 0, 5, 10, 15

## feature

[core, base, sub, paragon, prestige, origin, kiln]

## class types
[affix/prefix system?]
class types are different than "caster - martial - channeler" character types that are tied to traits:
  if you have either
    spellcasting, maneuvers, or channel powers, you count as a caster, martial or channeler respectively.
other character types, such as alchemist, artificer or other professions are tied to proficiency in tools.
your proficiency bonus with tools can be increased by renown. See: Journeyman.

(invoke names/entities, cast spells)
subtype: "tone/primary" - power: essence
(passive, primary, secondary)
warrior(honed/wit/brute): fighting style, maneuvers, focus
caster(learned/innate/pact): spellcasting, metamagic, additional access
priest(divine/primal/eldritch): paragon, channel, invocations

subtype: "kiln/secondary" - power: source
innate: metamagic, intuit [crucible -> temporary innate]
learned: acribic, ritual casting
pact: living spell

subtype: "chord/tertiary" - power: origin
arcane: primary damage types: all/none
primal(prime material): primary damage types: elemental, physical [primordial]
divine: primary damage types: necroti/radiant

-> 27 3-subtype combinations
up to 3 components. multiclass combinations are cut to 3.
blood hunter (warrior, arcane, {mutant}:crucible || {profane soul}:priest)

pure classes (one of subtype) ie. wizard(caster, arcane)
  diverging subclasses: 2 tones ie. wiz::bladesinger(caster, warrior)
  focussing subclasses: count a subtype doubly ie. wizard[subclass](caster, caster, arcane)
focussing multiclasses? -> monk: you do not gain additional features, but you count your monk class levels as 3 levels for the purposes of gaining additional traits in your primary class
balanced multiclasses: lose primary class, gains an additional secondary class
mixed martial classes: style
  honed(flat boni, balanced, any style)
  wit(emphasize dex/precision, dice conversions and additional effects)
  brute(typecast certain ability score to str/con)
  -> intellect brute(psion!): typecast everything to intelligence
  adding subclass options that improve on the specific nature:
  -> speeding up spell progression (2/3rds caster): every 3 classes count as 2 additional as to spell progressions. Rest: 1, neglect. Rest 2 add another 1.

supertype: (spell slot progression, trait doctoring -> supplanting traits = grafting)
- spellcaster(cantrips, spellcasting(+ritual), "meta"[metamagic, scribe, pact])
  + non-
    barbarian, fighter, rogue, monk, bh, mh
  + half- -> construct by stacking martial with caster?
    -> divine smite, nature's wrath, x-infused
    (paladin, ranger, artificer) third: [profane soul, arcane trickster, eldritch knight]
  + full-
    -> feature regaining slots (outside of short-resting)
    (bard, sorcerer, wizard)(warlock)
- martial
  + maneuvers (martial cantrips/spells)
  + focus (stances, requiring resources: concentration)
  + drills (minor buffs, debuff removal, equipment prep, spell-like effects)
- expert
  + expertise
  + stroke of genius
  + escape strangling specifics (enhances trait tinkering)
- hybrid type (mixed?)
  : feature converts spell slots into
  -- [armor, cantrip-type, weapon]
  warrior(honed) derived classes:
  -> "half-casters"
    spell-like ability, fueled by expending spell slots
      paladin (cha/wis)
      (medium armor, maneuvers, mastery(longsword), non-finesse martial melee weapons)
        -> convert smite spells into abilities
        channel - smite: if spell prepared, add a smite effect
          - aura: self and allies
      ranger (wis/int)
      (light armor, maneuvers, mastery(shortsword, longbow), finesse martial melee weapons, non-firearm martial ranged weapons)
        -> traps, consumables,
        channel - imbue: consumables, self-buff
          - triggers and traps -> traps
      artificer (int/cha)
      (heavy armor, mastery(tools), firearms)
        infuse: spell-like effects to equipment
          - aura: lasting on equipment

  monk(extreme dedication: double progression, no additional features), psion(raw arcane prodigy), mystic()
    psi/chi (psi -> chi: "bodied" psi)

closeness in type:
caster:
  bard - artificer - : both have "create" spells worldly

subclass-less: "pure"/generic class: counts as a prestige and paragon class.
  - gains quicker progressions by foregoing subclass choice
  - more resources?
  - gains "featureless pilferer"

## paragon class type
paragon of:
  might (fighter/psion/barbarian)
  cunning (bard/rogue, through paragon pilfering)
  {deity}/elemental {element} (cleric/druid)
  power (fighter)
  arcana (wizard/sorcerer)
  {any: warlock}

warrior paragon -> champion/cavalier (warrior/warrior/warrior)
  fighter: typecast any martial ability [typecast]
priest paragon: choose invocations paragon progression (priest/priest/priest)
  primal paragon: channel: elemental wildshapes
  divine paragon:
caster paragon (caster/caster/caster)
  wizard
    scribe: typecast spell-like abilities into arcane spells
    onomant: drop material and somatic components, power words, smaller spell book
warlock doesn't advance any other progressions. typecast class
(hybrid classes aren't paragon classes)

## prestige
