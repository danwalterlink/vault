"action surge becomes a general feature -> [[]]
if you dont want feature to be readily accessible through multiclassing/trait doctoring, make it an amalgam feature (features that exist through layering if class features) and describe the fantasy/surrounding ideas through the closest (sub)class

## class types
subtype: "tone/primary"
warrior(honed/wit/brute): fighting style
caster(learned(ritual casting)/innate/pact): spellcasting
priest(divine/primal/eldritch): channel {{source}}, ritual casting

subtype: "kiln/secondary"
crucible/pact: prolong temporary buffs, permanence, living spell
innate: metamagic, improvise
learned: acribic, ritual casting

subtype: "chord/power/tertiary"
arcane: damage types: all[elemental, raw=arcane=force, ], )
primal: damage types: elemental
divine: damage types: necrotic/radiant
material -> all damage types:

-> 27 3-subtype combinations
up to 3 components. multiclass combinations are cut to 3.
blood hunter (warrior, arcane, {mutant}:crucible || {profane soul}:priest)

pure classes (one of subtype) ie. wizard(caster, arcane)
  diverging subclasses: 2 tones ie. wiz::bladesinger(caster, warrior)
  focussing subclasses: count a subtype doubly ie. wizard[subclass](caster, caster, arcane)
focussing multiclasses? -> monk: you do not gain additional features, but you count your monk class levels as 3 levels for the purposes of gaining additional traits in your primary class
balanced multiclasses: lose primary class, gains an additional secondary class
mixed martial classes:
  - honed(fighter)
  paladin (warrior/divine)
  ranger (warrior/primal)
  ? artificer (warrior/arcane)
  - wit (apply generics through dice)
  - brute (typecast to a certain attribute/ability score)
  -> intellect brute(psion!): typecast everything to intelligence
  adding subclass options that improve on the specific nature:
  -> speeding up spell progression (2/3rds caster): every 3 classes count as 2 additional as to spell progressions. Rest: 1, neglect. Rest 2 add another 1.

supertype: (spell slot progression, trait tinkering)
- spellcaster(cantrips, spellcasting(+ritual), "meta"[metamagic, scribe, pact])
  + non-
    barbarian, fighter, rogue, monk, bh, mh
  + half- -> construct by stacking martial with caster?
    -> divine smite, nature's wrath, x-infused
    (paladin, ranger, artificer) third: [profane soul, arcane trickster, eldritch knight]
  + full-
    -> feature regaining slots (outside of short-resting)
    (bard, sorcerer, wizard)(warlock)
- martial
  + maneuvers (martial cantrips/spells)
  + focus (stances, requiring resources: concentration)
  + drills (minor buffs, debuff removal, equipment prep)
- expert
  + expertise
  + stroke of genius
  + escape strangling specifics (enhances trait tinkering)
mixed type
  half-casters
  monk(extreme dedication: double progression, no additional features), psion(raw arcane prodigy), mystic()
    psi/chi (psi -> chi: "bodied" psi)

closeness in type:
caster:
  bard - artificer - : both have "create" spells worldly
