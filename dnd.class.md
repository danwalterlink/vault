## class types
class types are different than "caster - martial - channeler" character types that are tied to traits:
  if you have either
    spellcasting, maneuvers, or channel powers, you count as a caster, martial or channeler respectively.
other character types, such as alchemist, artificer or other professions are tied to proficiency in tools.
your proficiency bonus with tools can be increased by renown. See: Journeyman.

(invoke names, cast spells)
subtype: "tone/primary" - power: essence
warrior(honed/wit/brute): fighting style
caster(learned(ritual casting)/innate/pact): spellcasting
priest(divine/primal/eldritch): channel {{source}}
(rituals?)

subtype: "kiln/secondary" - power: source
crucible/pact: prolong temporary buffs, pact, living spell
innate: metamagic, improvise
learned: acribic, ritual casting

subtype: "chord/power/tertiary" - power: origin
arcane: damage types: all[elemental, raw=arcane=force, ], )
primal: damage types: elemental
divine: damage types: necrotic/radiant
material -> all damage types:

-> 27 3-subtype combinations
up to 3 components. multiclass combinations are cut to 3.
blood hunter (warrior, arcane, {mutant}:crucible || {profane soul}:priest)

pure classes (one of subtype) ie. wizard(caster, arcane)
  diverging subclasses: 2 tones ie. wiz::bladesinger(caster, warrior)
  focussing subclasses: count a subtype doubly ie. wizard[subclass](caster, caster, arcane)
focussing multiclasses? -> monk: you do not gain additional features, but you count your monk class levels as 3 levels for the purposes of gaining additional traits in your primary class
balanced multiclasses: lose primary class, gains an additional secondary class
mixed martial classes:
  - honed(fighter)
  ? artificer (warrior/arcane)
  - wit (apply generics through dice)
  - brute (typecast to a certain attribute/ability score)
  -> intellect brute(psion!): typecast everything to intelligence
  adding subclass options that improve on the specific nature:
  -> speeding up spell progression (2/3rds caster): every 3 classes count as 2 additional as to spell progressions. Rest: 1, neglect. Rest 2 add another 1.

supertype: (spell slot progression, trait tinkering)
- spellcaster(cantrips, spellcasting(+ritual), "meta"[metamagic, scribe, pact])
  + non-
    barbarian, fighter, rogue, monk, bh, mh
  + half- -> construct by stacking martial with caster?
    -> divine smite, nature's wrath, x-infused
    (paladin, ranger, artificer) third: [profane soul, arcane trickster, eldritch knight]
  + full-
    -> feature regaining slots (outside of short-resting)
    (bard, sorcerer, wizard)(warlock)
- martial
  + maneuvers (martial cantrips/spells)
  + focus (stances, requiring resources: concentration)
  + drills (minor buffs, debuff removal, equipment prep, spell-like effects)
- expert
  + expertise
  + stroke of genius
  + escape strangling specifics (enhances trait tinkering)
- hybrid type (mixed?)
  : feature converts spell slots into
  -- [armor, cantrip-type, weapon]
  warrior(honed) derived classes:
  -> "half-casters"
    spell-like ability, fueled by expending spell slots
      paladin (cha/wis)
      (medium armor, maneuvers, mastery(longsword), non-finesse martial melee weapons)
        -> convert smite spells into abilities
        channel - smite: if spell prepared, add a smite effect
          - aura: self and allies
      ranger (wis/int)
      (light armor, maneuvers, mastery(shortsword, longbow), finesse martial melee weapons, non-firearm martial ranged weapons)
        -> traps, consumables,
        channel - imbue: consumables, self-buff
          - triggers and traps -> traps
      artificer (int/cha)
      (heavy armor, mastery(tools), firearms)
        infuse: spell-like effects to equipment
          - aura: lasting on equipment

  monk(extreme dedication: double progression, no additional features), psion(raw arcane prodigy), mystic()
    psi/chi (psi -> chi: "bodied" psi)

closeness in type:
caster:
  bard - artificer - : both have "create" spells worldly
