the world is magic'd and magic is worlded.
removing a curse requires a ritualistic drawing out of the suffusing powers. Often, additional imolements are needed.
Running white quartz sand through the lightly clenched fist in loose circles around the afflicted creature, the grains slowly vibrate into shapes of fine runes in unison with your low chant.
Your companions have 3 silver-imbued swords buried hand-deep into loose, scented earth. They brace themselves to erect stronger conduits for the fell and its probable shadowspawn your spell could birth.

over:
  determined to free the material - and thus the multiverse - from the shackles of order, the abyss tries to merge with the it. Extraplanar entities have an easier time existing on certain pockets of the prime material to either keep the existing order, or side with chaos for their own ends.

## optional rules
### additional feats and talents
? martial : resource conversion
-> for every 50% of your base movement : convert into resource, i.e. reactions.
  if actions taken in opposing turns, you can convert your resource from last or next turn up to your current turn-maximum of resource
  (so 100% movement/t, but you can divvy up into future)

### vials, shots and potions
holsters and belts are available as adventuring gear
since adventuring is rather commonplace

administering potions via shots is more direct than orally.
intravenous: check DC 25 + (2-(medicine - wis - prof))x3 (effects cumulative with intramusc)
- all effects over time are gained immediately
- minimize malus effects you would roll for
intramuscular: DC 15, can be done remotely (via blowdart, syringe-gun (only low/partial dose))
- maximize bonus effects you would roll for

subcutaneously:
- all positive effects double, but are over time

-> magical syringes: you can administer half doses with the same effectiveness as full doses. quarter doses have half effect. Lesser doses have no effect.
  you have to clean working material or risk infection.

you have to clean your material afterwards or risk infection

### spellcasting
material suffers magical fatigue. if material isn't made to accomodate magic, casting magic on it does put strain on it.

casting spells is interacting with the weave of the world. While you might be able to overcome the complication of omitting minor material components by using an arcane focus, trying to cast a verbal spell while being in a bubble of silence is nigh impossible. In this Multiverse, meaning is, literally.
Verbal components need intent behind them or sputter. Arcane symbols hang in the air, components are being consumed. Spells are tied to objects or involve living creatures as targets.
You can change spells slightly through study or improvisation, but experimenting on the field incurs costs. Trying to cast a spell without somatic components makes the spell being cast nigh impossible.

casting a fireball cools your surroundings very slightly or connects to the elemental plane of fire, for example.

### typecasting
whenever you gain a character feature, you may typecast.
typecast: change the associated ability score modifier on a character feature.
All derived checks and calculations change accordingly.

### trait tinkering
whenever you gain a character feature, you may tinker with traits.
Trait doctoring: select a feature gained on a class level up to your cumulative class type level of its class.

### infusions
items have a chance to lose their infusions and magical traits.
add your artificer proficiency to checks

### magic and items
magic is strenuous to the materials it's used on. using it too much on the same material might break them, especially if it's the same caster, casting in the same manner.

### mutate
you become temporarily infused with the plane of your strongest affiliation, or let the weave - raw, wild magic born of all planes - and roll on the associated table to gain mutations according to your mutation level (the number of times you have mutated - 1).
· wild -> wild magic table

## feats
arcane transmogrant(req: expertise in arcana):
  if you interact with a spell and pass an arcana check of DC = 12 + 2 x the spells level. you memorize the spell.
  clear success: perfectly. You can cast it once while only expending a spell slot of half the spells level (rounded up).
  (no 2 mental stats at least 13): you can't distinguish between (clear) failure and success
  success: without flaws.
  failure: with flaws. casting it rolls on the magic abberation table: additionally, rolling 10 or lower fails the spell. You take double the time and resources to scribe it.
  (3 mental stats at least 13): treat clear failures as regular failure
  clear failure: very flawed. roll on the magic aberration table twice. Additionally, rolling 10 or lower fails the spell. Scribing the spell automatically fails.

anatomical arcana, req: proficiency with harvesting tools
  arcana/perception(int/wis) check as an appraising as bonus action to reveal critical information about the creature.
  free object (inter)action during first round of combat, otherwise bonus action,
  check: DC 10 + CR of target
  if you have expertise or at least equivalence (eg. master harvester) in harvesting or appraising, you may add your bonus to the anatomical arcana check.
  trophies, having harvested and crafted items involving creatures of the same family increases the value of the mod added to the check by 2 (up to 10).
  clear failure: probably wrong information you believe to be true
  slight failure: probably wrong or no information you're unsure of
  slight success: your choice of: attacks, general affiliation/type/alignment, resistances, special attributes
  on clear success adv. on attack rolls equal to int/wis mod, crit range increase equal to half prof mod, rounded down.
  on critical failure: critical strikes don't deal increased damage.

arcorrupt duelist, requisite: extraplanar affiliation
  whenever you use your reaction to interact with a spell an opponent controls, you may either:
  · cast a cantrip with the spells controller as the target
  · use your concentration to weave the magical energy into another spell of the same level or lower up to 6 without expending a spell slot.
  · use your concentration to empower your next spell being cast by raising it by the level of the interacted spell up to level 6.
  , mutate.

corrupt conduit, requisit: extraplanar affiliation
  whenever a creature casts a spell or uses an ability within your reach, use your reaction to pit your raw being (primary ability) against their spell prowess DC = their spell save dc or 10 + the spell lvl), to:
