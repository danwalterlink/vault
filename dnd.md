## manifesto
competitive optimizations niche
roleplay and expression stand at the forefront
system mechanics that mechanically underline fantasies, instead of relying on strained reflavoring.
dungeon dudes: lets call a spade a spade: dnd5.5, what is dnd6?

back to power discussion: the overall sentiment: dial things back from PM/GWF and SS/CbE. While I agree that these are performance outliers that stick out like a sore thumb, the gambling aspect is really fun.
generally, versatility is powerful.
but all builds that perform similarly to the abovementioned follow a formula of: let's make the biggest hammer, treat everything as a nail.
ie. overload a singular feature and (over)saturation the action economy with that one feature.
Once you saturate your action economy with mechanically advantageous options, every additional option adds less and less to the overall power of a character.
Additionally, from a design perspective, the size of the power delta between mechanically optimized and primarily flavourful player characters is a kink that warrants ironing out.
If you want to spend all your customization options towards combat, over a certain threshold, options don't add that much.
For a thought experiment, if we'd amalgamate ALL outlier builds together, and massively inflate our stats, it doesn't massively outperform any individual build.
The main bottleneck is the action economy, rather than the amount of customization options. I'd rather hand out more options, while providing a minimal core of power-features, to mechanically enable expression of character.
Options as provided, sound more like ultimatums rather than choices.
