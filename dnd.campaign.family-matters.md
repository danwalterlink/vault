    - Idea of Undermountain
    - knows of sigil
  used to be Veiled Lord of Waterdeep
  Lycanthropy infested
    in search of druidic aid

his idea to use old waterdivhian tradition of exile by the yawning portal
personality:
  gruff and demeaning. outwardly racist – in line with dwarven image –,
  but all the gruffness is kindness in disguise.

## setting
### planecrash
planes fusing together.
undermountain connects to the tower of sigil and the innermost of outer planes.
- postulated undermountain connected to abyss layers
- creeping doom released
- daurgothoth subsumed/consumed mystra - new age of magic
- elminster and co. are remnants of the old guard : mystra and the original weave still somewhat persist.
