gameplans
are simple.
and starts from the [[brianF:hitHim]] #resources
elevate our critical thinking tank above memes:

the gameplans are simple, because the game is simple, that doesn't mean not deep:
[core-a: no dlc air-fireball|https://youtu.be/C3q5nSqGXr4?t=58]
grows from your understanding of the game.
simply put: finding strong options, applying them in the right situation.
or put differently:
[brianF: hitHim!] more than they hit you!

thinking hard, back to memes:
encapsulated: [flowchart-ken|https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.kym-cdn.com%2Fentries%2Ficons%2Foriginal%2F000%2F001%2F065%2Fken.jpg&f=1&nofb=1]
these options are:
- skew heavily in your favor (jump-in)
- mess with the opponent (dp-everything)
- synergise with each other (more dp -> better mashes on WU)
- ALL: put the onus on opponent
-> rebolas games
once you figure out how to deal with raw sweeps and you can anti-air. ez.

might think the strongest thing is "jumping in"?
it does the most damage?
you are vulnerable forever (40+ frames)!
-> strongest option in the game?
  - least vulnerable that gives you an advantage/pressures opponent
ie. walking!
different question: are there non-neutral/unfair situations?
-> pressure
up in their grill with frameAdvantage
block? -> throw!
take the throw?
(delay?)-tech, os-walk, backdash, jump, v-shift?
least risky is probably os-walk-block
but there are situations where you can't walk back:
even better: Oki, special case of pressure, where they wake up into multiple options
even even better: oki in the corner!
- they can't OS-walk out of throws -> strike-throw is better -> shimmy
- your punishes get better
- most characters have unique setups
- any knockdown -> rinse&repeat
you want:
- all advantage
- as few interactions as possible

core sfv = strike/throw, and the framedata reflects this:
unreactable throw - 5 frame startup, 3-active, 7 frame tech-window ~15 frames
– rule of thumb: around 17 frames is reactable if you're looking for it.
even though 15 frames ~= 250ms, there's no way you react to that.
at that range it could be anything. frame-1 distinguishing? impossible.
but most pokes are reactable – on whiff
[framedata: fatonline startup+active+recovery]: 20+ frames
and you are positioned way differently!
-> grounded footsies
minimal risk [day9: mostlyWalking], massive reward [punk: hitconfirming c.mK]
luckily, SF is "solved" game
there is a de-facto "best" playstyle:
grounded hit-confirm footsies.

what we truly need to work on are the underlying ideas:
[[thinking with sticks]]
-> similar to mtg-card-evaluation
or how to get from neutral to advantaged?
knockdown

again, more abstractly:
layers:
what is the "atom" of this game?
what does "strong" mean?
this builds layer0
common situations/neutral?
  strong options
  - what is hard to deal with

specific phases of the game:
  generalize certain situations

it's not complicated, but I have never heard it explicitly stated.
Obviously you start building out layer after layer, which are character-specific interactions.

now, where do I stand?...
