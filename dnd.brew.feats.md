enable power-fantasy of gwm-pom||shs-cbe, by enabling the core fantasy in more ways.
-> generic power attack:
  gambling: scale: (-1 attack roll -> +2 dmg roll)xmaxPmod, 2->3, 3-4 (choose either attack or dmg mod, other gets calcd: rounded up.), can only go up in a turn.
-> allow dynamic resource allocation

feat tiers
-> again, prerequisites, tie passive abilities to active choices:
· resource allocation
· action modification

achievable through more general keyword/tag system.
traits are exclusive?
-> tie to progression chart that has choice restriction in the chart

class passives
: how granular are build choices
-> separate feature
-> generic feats, prerequisites
  maneuvers for martial classes
  steal from ygp.
    overhaul:
      ranger
        lean into different playstyles
      barbarian
        pro/con rage, reckless attack

### feats
shared mind:
(becomes highly abusable with: one-sided telepathy block, sleeping potions or as torture)
arcane etchings back of head, willing participants rest back to back for one minute to implant their mind into the one not concentrating.
moving more than 30 ft apart from one another without other means of telepathy ends the bond.
unconscious or charmed creatures are considered willing.
  - without concentrating, either party hears the others thoughts as if they were their own
  - as an action, you can assume control of a willing party
  - either party makes concentration checks with disadvantage
  - either party takes psychic damage if any party takes psychic damage not received via this trait
  - you cannot rest

#### shield master
  {++}
  you can don a shield as your free item interaction.
  you may use armor class calculations that forbid using a shield with shields.
  shield bash: advantage on shove action

#### arcane notes
  if you discerned the makeup of an arcane spell, you may use generic spell components and magical ink to scribe the spell into your spellbook.
  there is a chance at least parts of the spell have escaped your scrutiny or intricacies have eluded your mind.
  For each 3 points you have missed the DC (10 + double the spells level) of the target spell

#### poisoner
- 1 dose = coating amount on dagger or 3 pieces of ammunition for it to show effects
- heavy dose = not deliverable via coating. consumes double the amount of poison and requires a special container
- craft 1 heavy dose by distilling 2 normal ones
- ignore resistance
- half damage as acid damage if immune

#### sharpshooter
- no quarter: you treat half as no and 3/4 as half cover and other foes do not impede line of sight.
- versatile: you can use any attack maneuver with ranged weapons
- focus: if you haven't moved this turn +1 to attack and damage rolls with ranged attacks.
- eagle eyed: no disadvantage max range; you can discern color even in dim environments.

-> change max distance on bows based on strength
: 300 long; below 10 str: 300ft
  half for every negative ASMod

#### close-quarters shooter
