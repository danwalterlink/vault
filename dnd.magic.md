magic is worlded;
Growing plants are magical. Common carpentry is magical. Cobbling the lowliest
shoe is magical through the passage of time and simply existing.
The world itself is magical.
Artfully interacting, is more refined, denser magic. When folk say "magical",
the often mean "high magic". When an objects threads of existence
are woven so intricately, so exquisitely, that it bends the weave,
the "grid" that holds reality itself. That's what one calls "magical".
Mundance things are still, inherently, magical, if just slightly.
Manipulating the weave directly is arcane magic. It's raw, crackling power.
Mostly an expression of deft and cunning, direct means to certain ends.
Primalists often dismiss it as blunt, rigid, slovenly and caricaturesquely oversimplified
imitations of nature, or pale imitations of deific deeds, should you ask the their
divine counterparts. Non-priest pacters don't care about such trivialities.
Such warlocks seize power in any way they can, tomorrow's price be damned.

No matter the source that powers that cast of "mending" on a pair of boots,
the same boots mended over and over, "spreads them thin". The soles wear out quickly,
the leather doesn't give at all, or at the wrong places.
Laces tear at the slightest tuck and eventually even pebbles pierce their soles.

Without a deep, intimate and caring understanding of a thing, its magical creation
can only be called a hollow replica.
They're facsimile meeting only the most basic of needs.

Accordingly, grown food from magical dabblers, or even learned magi not versed
in the culinary arts tastes bland, dissolves into textureless sustenance
and only with the utmost culinary expertise can it sate more but a basic need.
Subsiding on mass magical sustenance is feasible, but entirely undelectable for
even the least magically inclined, and eroding for the minds of the attuned.
Since the dawn of the new weave, Netheril structures supplying endless mana
consume themselves into nullzones periodically, resuming their function shortly thereafter.
Oftentimes, parts of their arcane weft distorts into nonsense and sputtering
malfunctions following their violent tear from the weave.

Most feel naueous dread when exposed to null fields, even if magically ungifted.
Others' tempers flare from white hot rage to sopping sadness in seconds,
ebbing with the maelstrom tides pulled into these ancient automata.
You see massive, majestic monstrosities scuttle in terror, crawling backwards,
away from the depthless rend that threatens to swallows their little universe.

Luckily, most of these artifacts have torn themselves to pieces,
given the centuries of disuse and disrepair, leaving echoes of the magical might
of the Netheril, often fashioned into powerful artifacts by adventurous tinkerers.

If you don't allow time to nestle and weed the elements of your creation,
but force them into a newly fashioned state in fractions of a second,
all through the sheer might of your will or intimate knowledge of threads
arcane both more calcifiedly ancient while burdened with futures than anything
already affixed, woven into the rich tapestry of the prime materium.

While invaluable, such power demands dues, exacting and with interest.
While the, in comparison with the Netheril, medieval contemporary societies
have eliminated homelessness, starvation and unemployment. Still,
with all the worlds to spare – planes, magic and arcaneries –, they precipitate
into hard casts: those with power, and those without.
In tandem with disregard for "lessers", such a "cess", in miring in its purportedly
closed economical echochamber, reverberating ruthless rhetorics,
that slowly pervade very conceivable corner, edge and plane of its known,
little multiverse.

Invariably, despite the general need for their artisanry, craftsmanship,
inquisitiveness and expertise, people of all folks are gauged lesser
for their diminished aptitude in the arcane, primal or divine,
for magic is closest to power. In a world where a precipitous drop
belies illusory ground around every corner, demons wage wars by proxy
just for fun, dragons for their own opaque ends, stifled by elvenkind,
who, collectively, sacrificing millions to weave a spell so potent,
it branded celestial bodies and whipped all dragonkind into a genocidal frenzy
so ultimately ruinous, draconic civilisation as a whole was scorched in days,
never to be rebuilt and driving all survivors into hermitage.

Might makes right.
And more might unmakes wrongs. At least, that's how it's been.
Where gods walk the earth. Ancient dragons spend entire lifetimes polymorphed
among other folk. And all this happens on the uppermost crust, over layers
and layers of crumbled civilisations that came before, and denizens of this
plane, somewhat understandably, find themselves in a constant backstabbing
frenzy of corpsepiling flight. Away from the beyond, to shunt the edges of the map
and erect barriers so tall and thick, no leviathan could hope to breach it.

Many races have fallen to this cycle of life. And the current wretch in the wheel
is the shortlived human, after the more elder races have ground each other into
shadows of their past. Just as with orcs, humans have the miraculous ability to grow.
Each individual a smaller speck, but collectively resilient, they seem so small
and feeble. Giants roam still, and even dwarves outlive them by centuries.

With clear edges in largely insular societies, the chance to break the mold through
adventuring has become by far the best regarded, honored and lucrative profession
any "lesser" can readily partake in. With the simple wager of your very existence,
regularly stumbling into a precarious balance of power, unwittingly tipping towers
built by deities forgotten more times than most races have ancestors,
clashing against forces backed by malicious discards of creation,
revolting their status as refuse, inviting eldritch entities from realms so removed,
so alien, a grazing touch of their behemoth essence bends reality.
With the general want and desparate need for adventurous spoils, the call to adventure
sounds truer and louder than ever.
