calculations: averages are rounded down
## trait: luck
if multiple dice in the same roll show the same face, you add one of these dice to your dice .
luck to the bold: legerdemain skill contest: you appropriate the dice and store it for a rainy day. Swap either the number or size of a dice roll with your stored dice.
## default critical misses
  messing with resources adds to the messed with resource instead while losing your expended resource.
## resources
{interface}: "once per {length} rest" is equivalent to 1d2 dice, doubling in size per stacking instance.
heroic inspiration can be converted into resource dice.
future resource gains of the same type are cut in dice size until recuperating rest, rounded down.
ie. a d6 resource becomes a d2 resource becomes 1. A feature becomes an illegal action, if you can't pay its base costs, even if a trait allows you to pay alternate costs.
-> maintaining at least 1 resource die becomes very important -> recovery worsens drastically if you expend all of it.
-> damage you receive can be in the form of resources
-> hit dice on equipment becomes an available resource to spend
-> can take reactions only if you haven't expended your reaction.
  using your reaction does not need expend it. It may pose restrictions in the future: ie:
      elven bladesinging armor:
        hardening: as a reaction, you increase your ac by +2. Until the end of your next turn, spells you cast can only be of range:touch or less(self).
        (notice it doesn't say expend).
        rules note: effects of the same name don't stack.

## item hit dice
along the {{generic object}} table.
object[size[tiny,...,huge], ac[material[paper,11],...,[adamantine,23]],dice.size[d4,...,10], dice.amount[2,...,5], modifier:[craftingQuality, trait[resilient:2,fragile:1/2]]
-> retrieving arrows: arrow[1d4]

## trait doctoring
having traits with the same name in different categories and layering traits/features on top of them could be interesting:
  ie. mage slayer (focus: ); (weapon mastery); (spellcasting specialization)
  (generic improvement):slasher: enhances "mage slayer": a creature hit with the attack while casting or continuing a spell becomes vulnerable to {slashing} damage

## d20 tests
skill checks: modes of success:
  clear failure/success: -/+ 5 or more of DC
  slight failure/success: -/+ 4 or less of DC

## action surge
you may spend/do up to double your turn rate, by trading:
- last turn's remaining resource at half the rate
- this turn's remaining resource at rate
- next turn's remaining resource at half the rate
(or unlimited, but usage prorates)

action class: (more dex, yields more speed)
  reaction: speed

actions have different additional costs:
ie. spells somatic components require movement speed.
this means that some spells can be cast

minimal ritual:
- dc check to cast, fail to make less effective

## maneuver: power attack
((-1 attack roll := +2 damage)x up to weapon dice size/2)xup to prof mod
## maneuver: precision attack
((-1 attack roll)xweapon dice size/2 := expanded clean hit range // crit range)x up to prof mod
## focus: enhanced attack
concentrate on applying a maneuver to an attack without expending resources. If a feature allows you to expend additional resources, you may apply them at a rate of normal expenditure/prof mod (rounded down)
(this implies that if you lose concentration, you lose the attack advantage. you roll concentration checks as if concentrating on a spell.
similarly, a spellcaster that casts a spell that doesn't ask concentration, while casting, you still roll for concentration checks as if you were concentrating.)
## focus: mage slayer
  if a creature takes a magic action within your reach, you may expend your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature.
  the target rolls d20 tests made this way to maintain concentration on casting or continuing spells with disadvantage.

## resources
generally, resource changes and allocations add dice
(also, resource expenditure can be indicated by dice size)
-> generation of feature usage makes dice smaller (until size breakpoint)
## proficiency
proficiency dice
## heroic inspiration
in addition, heroic inspiration can fuel abilities
## modes of success
4 stage:
  clear/clean fail/success : by 5 or more
  fail/success
  also applies to hits: clean hit:
    clean hit: one additional hit dice, slight chance of resource replenishment
    sloppy? failure: minor mishap

3 stage: from binary
  dc Â± 2:
  -> generally: spells that have binary outcome have a 3rd option, with either advantage or disadvantage for slight fail/success
  (flavoured: "catching failed attempts": try again with disadvantage by slight misses)

## criticals
1: roll on the associated minor mishap table
double 1 on disadvantage: major mishap table
critical success (if roll additional dice, resource replenish if rolled nice)
## magical fatigue
even the most mundane things work their magic. an ancient fireplace might kindle itself. using things infuses them with your being. magical weapons lose their edge when used as paperweights too often.
an arcane focus might alleviate the need of components, but it grows gaunt and its magics shallow if not
