## d20 tests
skill checks: modes of success:
  clear failure/success: -/+ 5 or more of DC
  slight failure/success: -/+ 4 or less of DC
## action surge
you may spend/do up to double your turn rate, by trading:
- last turn's remaining resource at half the rate
- this turn's remaining resource at rate
- next turn's remaining resource at half the rate
(or unlimited, but usage prorates)

action class: (more dex, yields more speed)
  reaction: speed

actions have different additional costs:
ie. spells somatic components require movement speed.
this means that some spells can be cast

minimal ritual:
- dc check to cast, fail to make less effective

## modes of success
4 stage:
  clear fail/success : by 5 or more
  fail/success

3 stage: from binary
  dc Â± 2:
  -> generally: spells that have binary outcome have a 3rd option, with either advantage or disadvantage for slight fail/success
  (flavoured: "catching failed attempts": try again with disadvantage by slight misses)

## criticals
1: roll on the associated minor mishap table
double 1 on disadvantage: major mishap table
## magical fatigue
even the most mundane things work their magic. an ancient fireplace might kindle itself. using things infuses them with your being. magical weapons lose their edge when used as paperweights too often.
an arcane focus might alleviate the need of components, but it grows gaunt and its magics shallow if not
## grievous wounds

## crafting
## infusions
