### feats
poisoner
- 1 dose = coating amount on dagger or 2 pieces of ammunition for it to show effects
- heavy dose = not deliverable via coating. consumes double the amount of poison and a special container
- craft 1 heavy dose
- ignore resistance
- half damage as acid damage if immune

Potions
: healing potions restore health according to : minor healing potion (2d4 + constitution modifier) ||
: HoT: when you roll for healing of a potion and roll beneath half max, you heal for 1/2 max.
  anything over 1/2 is restored over time at 1 hp/round for basic healing potion (increases with potion strength)
: (un)common potions of healing make you hungry;  healing without magical support depletes your bodily resources.
  Every maximized hit dice worth of hp and every regained hit dice increases your need for sustenance by a cumulative hit dice size/100.
  If you cannot ingest enough food to satisfy your hunger, you can't regain hit dice during that rest, and all healing reliant on hit dice is halved until you eat your fill.

Prestige Classes: when meeting criteria, your most advanced class becomes the base class for the prestige class. Future class advancements may not invalidate past choices.
  bonus features will unlock when cumulative class type levels reach thresholds.
  Advance in 2 Classes simultaneously up to a maximum.
  Mystic Theurge: 3+ Caster / 3+ Priest or higher, but still balanced levels. (eg. 2-Cleric, 2 Paladin, 3 Wizard), Max Level = Level of Base Class
    6/6/6

Partial class progression:
  pick features from a class belonging to the same type of the advancing class. The chosen class feature must be of a level less than half your total class type level.

Typecast:
  Class: Subclasses may alter class type.
  Ability association: when typecasting a feature, it, and all subfeatures thus gained, change their associated ability to another.
  #i features become less effective, the more centralized it becomes.
  -> uses of typecasting are inversely tied to diversity of ability scores.

Cumulative Subclasses:
  - Scaling features and sidegrades
  - typeclass scaling and incentives to return to classes
