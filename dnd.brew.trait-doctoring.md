notes on multiclassing (~55:00)
Multiclass "cheese" isn't free. While, yes, the spectre of multiclassing looms over every future design decision,
in the feat(s) presented, you still have to take it/them, without immediate gain or gameplay changes.

More generally, there are ways to design around the frontloaded nature of classes - while keeping multiclassing in mind,
without additional layers of hard restriction. Introducing differing scalings, and, for lack of a better term, "size" of features, are but a few.
Heavy-handed design decisions, like the "dedication" class feature presented by monty, rub me the wrong way. It's so very blunt.

As an example: many recent changes went from tying progressions to proficiency modifiers, to class levels instead. You could just as well add other ways of scaling, like your combined caster class levels, proficiency modifier minus cumulative class levels, modifying features you acquire somewhere else, tying to resource expenditure, having used features (a certain way), giving you mali in (future) actions, using (or breaking) concentration, multiplying by negative ability modifiers or modifier combinations; essentially making them integrate with spellcasting - or whatever thing you want it to be removed from, less, without directly disabling them. I know that there's value in simplicity, but I'll always side with giving players "true" choices.

I brewed a generic feature very similar to this I dubbed "typecasting", that I tack onto all base classes, similar to "cantrip/martial/[...] versatility":
"Whenever you gain a class feature, you may instead gain a feature you would gain from a class that shares types [expert/martial, priest/divine, priest/primal, caster/arcane, occult/crucible] on a level of up to half your respective cumulative class type (rounded down)."
Which, in practice, clamps down on the general want to multiclass, because if I want a certain feature from a class, I can nab it without having to sacrifice class progression, but I have to give up generally stronger, higher level abilites, for lower leveled ones.
If a caster wants "action surge", for example, they need at least 4 martial class levels (not necessarily fighter) and trade their (sub)class feature - the cost of which is mitigated by the abundance of "ribbon features" -, to get it this way.
If you find multiclassing too strong, still, you could prorate cumulative type additions.
Or, alternately, which I find very intrigueing but haven't put to numbers: inversely prorate features gained from different class types by level; i.e. make multiclassed features ramp more, the higher your total level is, making these options weaker initially, but boost their raw power over the course of gaining levels to compensate for the lack of higher level features.

I also brewed (but mostly stole) prestige classes that advance in their base class(es) but have multiple class types and additional typecast features.
Among which is my beloved 3.5 "mystic theurge", that advances in either base class (cleric and wizard, but let's be honest, wizard), has both class types, you may take 5 levels of, if you meet it's criteria, being 3wizard/3cleric, and that advances both base classes' spellcasting progressions. Future class choices can't exceed either cumulative class type (priest or caster) level by more than double the other, which effectively bars you from reaching 9th-level wizard spells, unless you sacrifice your "mystic theurge" levels in favor of it's base class, or go past 20th level, all by doubling down on the "balanced" nature of being a caster-priest, and without stating that you can't cast 9th-level spells.
