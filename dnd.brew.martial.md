## martial features
### maneuver: power attack
((-1 attack roll := +2 damage)x up to weapon dice size/2)?(up to prof mod)
(improved by brute)

### maneuver: precision attack
((-1 attack roll)xweapon dice size/4 := expanded clean hit range // crit range)x up to prof mod
-> power stance: 2 weapon of same type: benefit
(improved by cunning/witty fighters)

### maneuver: honed attack
both precision and power at half efficiency
-1att x dmgDiceSize/2 = +2dmg+dmDiceSize/2)
improved by weapon mastery
-> variant: if longsword: when you expand crit range: 20, 1, 19, 2, ... instead.
  (optional variant): if you expand your crit range this way, the lowest roll not resulting in a crit becomes a crit miss instead

### focus: enhanced attack
concentrate on applying a maneuver to an attack without expending resources. If a feature allows you to expend additional resources, you may apply them at a rate of normal expenditure/prof mod (rounded down)
(this implies that if you lose concentration, you lose the attack advantage. you roll concentration checks as if concentrating on a spell.
similarly, a spellcaster that casts a spell that doesn't ask concentration, while casting, you still roll for concentration checks as if you were concentrating.)

### fighting style: orthodox
stance: you cannot critically strike, but your clean hit range expands by 2 and
mastery: your clean hits deal brutal damage

### focus: mage slayer
if a creature takes a magic action within your reach, you may expend your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature.
the target rolls d20 tests made this way to maintain concentration on casting or continuing spells with disadvantage.
when you dispel magic, you can either:
- ground the arcane energies, granting you 5ft of safe movement
- emit a 10/3SLft line of force originating from you dealing 1d6 of damage that either pulls or pushes creatures 5ft to or from it.
- store energy in your weapon. For the next minute, it deals an extra 1d6 of force damage

### focus: parry
you learned to wrestle the elements itself,
  same shape or reach, same damage type
  improvised weapon proficient, dex save dc 10+dex or half damage
