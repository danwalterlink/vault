## martial features
if multiple features change calculations, choose one.
attack maneuvers: after you use an attack maneuver, you roll atk
### maneuver: power attack
((-1 attack roll := +2 damage)x up to weapon dice size/2)?(up to prof mod)
(improved by brute)
- prorates per power attack
- sacrifice additional attacks for more power

### maneuver: precision attack
((-1 attack roll)xweapon dice size/4 := expanded clean hit range // crit range)x up to prof mod
-> power stance: 2 weapon of same type: benefit
(improved by cunning/witty fighters)
- sacrifice additional attacks for better accuracy

### maneuver: honed attack
both precision and power at half efficiency
-1att x dmgDiceSize/2 = +2dmg+dmDiceSize/2)
improved by weapon mastery
-> variant: if longsword: when you expand crit range: 20, 1, 19, 2, ... instead.
  (optional variant): if you expand your crit range this way, the lowest roll not resulting in a crit becomes a crit miss instead
- gain an additional attack, but prorates per use?
- can sacrifice additional attacks to gain either power or precision

### focus: enhanced attack
concentrate on applying a maneuver to an attack without expending resources. If a feature allows you to expend additional resources, you may apply them at a rate of normal expenditure/prof mod (rounded down)
(this implies that if you lose concentration, you lose the attack advantage. you roll concentration checks as if concentrating on a spell.
similarly, a spellcaster that casts a spell that doesn't ask concentration, while casting, you still roll for concentration checks as if you were concentrating.)
-> enhances attack maneuvers
: better scaling, but concentration

### fighting style: orthodox
stance: you cannot critically strike, but your clean hit range expands by 2 and
mastery: your clean hits deal brutal damage

### focus: mage slayer
since magic is worlded: strong focus. mere presence makes working with magic more strenuous.
you may not be able to cast spells, but you are attuned enough to disrupt it.
if you are able to weave spells, use dregs and tearings to infuse simpler castings.

if a creature takes a magic action within your reach, you may use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature.
the target rolls d20 tests made this way to maintain concentration on spells with disadvantage.
when you dispel magic, you can either:
- ground the arcane energies, granting you 5ft of safe movement
- emit a 10/3SLft line of force originating from you dealing 1d6 of damage that either pulls or pushes creatures 5ft to or from it.
- store energy in your weapon. For the next minute, it deals an extra 1d6 of force damage

### focus: parry
- gamble AC to parry
- gamble follow-up for effects
: features need be acquired elsewhere
: also works with spells
you learned to wrestle the elements itself,
  same shape or reach, same damage type
  improvised weapon proficient, dex save dc 10+dex or half damage
  - blow for blow: contested strikes
  - riposte
  - deflect: action economy
  - attack maneuver but only effects
  - attack replacement actions

feat: marksman, replaces "crossbow expert"
- you ignore the loading property of weapons you are proficient with
- being within 5 ft of your target does not impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks.
- gain a martial ranged weapon maneuver or "precise attack"

ranged weapon maneuver:
- barrage: overload: multiple in cone or circle
- steady: sacrifice movement to gain atk roll
- backstep/kite: 5 feet of safe movement
- trick shot: ricochet
- overpull: damage weapon to increase atk
- improvised ammunition

fighter -
additional extra attacks
  more efficient conversions

maneuver: coordinate

rule: flanking
  current flanking := surrounded += new flanking
  when flanking, flanking maneuvers: coordinate
