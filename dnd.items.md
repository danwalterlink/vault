## onomantic rune/glyph
  once per day cast, afterwards, the rune becomes "fuzzy".
  you may cast the inscribed spell as if you knew it without verbal or somatic components
  you may exchange costs of the spell with equivalent value by channeling your very essence, ie:
    - pay hit dice per spell level
    - pay usage of leveled features
  bypass arcane knowledge requirements if attuned to object

## arcane/divine/primal mental link clamp

  thoughts to reverberate in other creatures mind through telepathic channel opened through mental action.
    - allows casting as if other creature

    + allows non-casters to concentrate on spells
    + forces concentration checks on all parties involved if telepathic link is open
