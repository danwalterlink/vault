you are an adventurer. discovering the world, righting wrongs, loot:
whatever you do, you do it in the "prime materium" - the world -, "stuff".
The materium looks a lot like our universe.
It contains planets, suns, galaxies. It's as the name implies, matter.

It's also but ONE plane among many. it's the plane where all planes interweave.
where there's fire in the prime materium, the prime materium is interwoven with the elemental plane of fire.
the elemental planes sit closest, interwoven amongst each other, at some point being an elemental echo of the prime,
straying into elemental chaos,
unintelligible hot from cold melds into the sparse expanse of the astral sea, the "plane" of abstraction and idea,
that ,somehow, still weaves into the prime materium,
but also merges into the outer planes like "mechanicus", "elysium" or "the nine hells".
Space and Time are similar in planes and parts of planes "close" to the prime material,
becoming more and more meaningless the "further" you get.
Planes were once manifest through primordials, avatars of entire planes,
but constant mingling and weaving new brought new beings,
and with these new beings, gods.
According to many a folks' creation myth, these gods - paradoxically -
created the beings whose belief sustains them.
In any case, power was wrestled from primordials, and they resented and fought.
Gods currently standing on the apex of power in the universe of DnD tells of the gods' victory over primordials,
who were thus stripped further of influence.
Beings from the materium can travel to the planes in many ways.
Beings from planes can travel or create avatars on the prime materium,
but both ways are fraught with massive dangers and are demanding of both the plane and the being.

This "weave" itself is domain of 'mystra', also known as the goddess of magic.
Manipulating the weave directly is casting spells, bending reality to your will.
It takes raw extraplanar power or deep arcane understanding cast spells.
